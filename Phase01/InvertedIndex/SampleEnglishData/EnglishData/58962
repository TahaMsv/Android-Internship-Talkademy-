Anybody here have experience to the contraryI know that there is MSG sensitivity.  When I eat foods with MSG I gevery thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash. I firsexperienced this problem when I worked close to Chinatown and ate Chinesfood almost everyday for lunch.  Now I can't tolerate MSG at all.  I canotice immediately when I have eaten any.  I try to avoid MSG completelyInteresting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencinthe exact same rash on their hands.  I couldn't understand why because don't MSG in cooking and we ask for no MSG when we do eat Chinese (I stillove it).  After some investigation I knew that Oodles of Noodles wherone of their favorite foods.  One of the main ingredients in the flavopackets is MSG.  Now I look at all labels.  You would be surprised aplaces you find MSG/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\Betty Harvey  <harvey@oasys.dt.navy.mil>     | David Taylor Model BasiADP, Networking and Communication Assessment | Carderock Divisio     Branch                                  | Naval Surface WarfarCode 1221                                    |   CenteBethesda, Md.  20084-5000                    | DTMB,CD,NSWC                                               |  (301)227-3379   FAX (301)227-3343            |         /\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\\\/\\
