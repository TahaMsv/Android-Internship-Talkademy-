What I'd like to know are Toricelli'reasons for doing his experiment; not the post hoc _constructed_ reasonsbut the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem.  It may bimpossible to know much about Toricelli's thoughts; that's too bad iit is so.  One of Root-Bernstein's services to science is that he has gonrooting about in Pasteur's and Fleming's (and other people's) notes, and hadiscovered some surprising clues about their motivations.  Pasteur nevepublicly admitted his plan to create mirror-image life, but the dreams arright there in his notebooks (finally public after many years), ready foanyone to read.  And I and my friends often have the most ridiculoureasons for pursuing results; one of my best came because I was mad aa colleague for a poorly-written claim (I disproved the claim)Of course, Toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety: where thfantasy not only motivates the experiment, but turns out to be righin the endMar--Mark A.
