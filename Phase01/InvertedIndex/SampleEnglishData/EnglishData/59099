For several years I have been dealing with reccurring corneal  erosion.    Therdoes  not  seem  to be much known about the cause of such a problem.  My currenepisode is pretty bad since it is located in the middle of the cornea.  If  it'bad  enough, the usual treatment for it is puncture therapy.  However, my doctothis time is trying to let it heal by  itself  by  putting  a  contact  lens  tprotect the area.  Apparently the problem is not that common, but I'd be curiouif anyone else out there has a similar problem, perhaps to see if a cause can bfound.Mark LondoMRL@NERUS.PFC.MIT.ED
