One thing that I haven't seen in this thread is a discussion of threlation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fattacids (FAs)I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn's of the terminal ileum. When I goout of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across severastudies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducininflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies ardiscussed in "Inflammatory Bowel Disease," MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.But if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to bpicked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). Ithe studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of thstudies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of th_other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informelayperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs arconsumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of "bad" prostanoiproducts to "good" prostanoid products could still be fairly "bad.Isn't this ratio the issueWhat's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPsupplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAappear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be thlow absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories)-Brian <bmdelane@midway.uchicago.edu
