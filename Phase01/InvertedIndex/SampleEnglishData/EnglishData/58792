Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is alsowidely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity.And in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point isindicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he mightmake that he is unable to even leave the house. In science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possibleand we also want to have as much certainty as possible about thesediscoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata--- the search for scope and the search for certainty. If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton andLeibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neitherof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, sincethey lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack ofa rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus.It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solidgrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newtonand Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a greatdeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lostthrough the mistakes they made.

According to these posters  "If it\'s not supported bcarefully designed controlled studies then it\'s not science.Taken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studiesare everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultificationof science. For one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodologyresults in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outsidethe establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support haveno chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that thisis the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless,it is one of the results.)   And although institutional science hascertainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolisharrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever comewith anything worthwhile. Furthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think ione of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigatquestions because they can be readily handled by the currentlfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutionaor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention tthose questions which seem to have fundamental significanceFor instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated witstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in manareas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the paperresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questioninto a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin'assertion that current scientific methods "avoid all known errors."I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamentalerror in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of theothers.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of alltoo many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which areworthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place. -In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.  lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitne
