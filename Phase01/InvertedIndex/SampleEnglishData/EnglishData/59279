I don't know much about thneedles; however, I do know of a southwest Virginia country doctor whsome thrity or more years ago invented, patented, used, and sold a syringehypodermic needle combination that retracted, injected with the flip of trigger, then retracted, giving a near-painless injection.  The fellow waDr. Daniel Gabriel, and it was termed the Gabriel--somebody else syringe.Did you come across that one.  (Plastic, disposable syringes came onto thmarket about that time and his product went by the wayside, to my knowledge.
