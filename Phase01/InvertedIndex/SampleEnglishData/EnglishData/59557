I am quite near sightedI've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seaholes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. In mleft eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently thlaser was used to "weld" this back in place as wellMy right eye seems fine. In my left eye I was seeing occasionaflashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since thtreatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more ofte- several each hourThe opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because thvitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. Hsays this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its owaccord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachmentI am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachmentsThe Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanationso I appreciate any further details anyone can provide. Of mosinterest to meIf my retina does detach what should be my immediate coursof actionIf conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what ithe procedure like and what kind of vision can I expecafterwardsDo the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachmenmaybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarmMany thankBil--Bill Wilder, Computer Systems ManagerKentville Research StatioAgriculture CanadKentville, Nova Scoti
