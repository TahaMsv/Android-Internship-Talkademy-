I was picked fromy softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eyewhich put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to gean equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  Tcontrol the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  SincI was used to slow pitch, I didn't come close (actually I thinI foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of peopllike me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or arnot used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question thresults of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of majoleague players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to teswhether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was "better" but I don't know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was isaid that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in majoleaguers than across the general population - but I'm not surwhether I'd believe her.Janice Rathman
