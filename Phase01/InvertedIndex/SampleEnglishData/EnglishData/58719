You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to makeI fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between th*process* of science and the end result. As an end result of science, one wants to get results that arobjectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about th*process* of science. If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merito homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable informationBut it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  Thiis where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, onmust have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mercollection of empirically validated random hypothesesExperiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, buthey are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The mosimportant part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING. Without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (Nohypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough dataNor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving olooking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of reallgood thinking beforehand.) The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocrscientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology. It depends on the quality of their THINKING. It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe thathey are doing science merely because they are conducting empiricastudies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such acertain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all,but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses. And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion thascience amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoidinmistakes doesn't get you anywhere. -In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.  lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitne
