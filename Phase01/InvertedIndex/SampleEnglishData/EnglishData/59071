>The funny thing is the personaly stories about reactions to MSG vary s>greatly. Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Som>claim their heart "skipped" beats once in a whileBoth of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flusheface is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regulapulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels ithe blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both arsodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything elseone can get too much of a good thing>Some reacted with headache,Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increaseheart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteriesessentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepencher, necessarily>some stomach acheWell stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, nonecessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomitinoccurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism haeaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - thlist of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks aenzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or bellache) would be expected> Some had watery eyes or running noseThese are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similato vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxioucompounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possiblsome other food or environmental compound could be responsible for thsymptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effetcan be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would bnecessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the persowas exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiratioand heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far frosimple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body> som>had itchy skin or rashes.People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It dependupon what it is about the compound that "pisses off" their bodyPollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in manpeople, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and ahistamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboardcausing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with aallergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas thacontain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance caperturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.>More serious accusations include respiration>difficultySee above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatorproblems are not serious. They can be deadlyand brain damage.The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine systecontrolling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controllinthe cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatinand other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical>Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number on>suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just foopoisoning.Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plutoo much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking homeplus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 daybefore from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts othingsBut it might be the MSG.>if you heard things about MSG, you may think it must be itIf noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probablstomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic toAnyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in theiresponses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things          Dianne Murray  wcsbeau@ccs.carleton.c
