It is more than 99 percenteffective"This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to preventpregnancy," said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. "As an injectable,given once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related tomissing a daily dose.Depo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors andclinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptiveprotection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues theinjectionsAs with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits andrisks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professionalbefore making a decision to use itDepo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensivestudies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agenciesin other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found DepoProvera effective as an injectable contraceptiveThe most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. Inaddition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain,dizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who haveacute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or bloodclots in the legs, lungs or eyesThe labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing thedrug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 1Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199Recent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute toosteoporosis.

Sullivan, M.D. "The effortto accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment andindeed a hallmark of this administration."These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration toapprove a drug based on "surrogate endpoints" or markers. They apply when thedrug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Suchendpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not inthemselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualifiedscientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient.Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approvalearlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms orprevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used.The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety andeffectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established.The drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conductpostmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogateendpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness.One new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using amodel of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, thecause of AIDS.Accelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when FDA determines thata drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be usedsafely only under a restricted distribution plan."The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review processwithout sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight," said FDAcommissioner David A.

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered thatcertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors canprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. Thedegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause ofvisual impairment     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings ofthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may losetheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drugtreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 millionAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary diseasethat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergosurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas.     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa)Foundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National EyeInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, DouglasYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorgeYancoooulos, Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds anexclusive license for this research from UCSF     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used toassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurringsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week.Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of theirphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after lightexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary NeurotrophicFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causingunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) andInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments.     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron's Director ofClinical Research, said, "BDNF\'s ability to rescue neurons in the retina thathave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of agerelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment,and for retinal detachment.

It is possible that BDNFcould play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattachedsurgically."     "Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes theretina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreasesto a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hopethat research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progressionand preserve useful vision throughout life," stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D.,Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness.     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF inconjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment forperipheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy,motor neuron diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Byitself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateralsclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease).     Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is aleader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds forthe treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerveinjuries, which affect more than seven million Americans.

These findings, according toinvestigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, haveserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developingcountries.     "This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease andhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also theimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase bodyweight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developingcountries and affluent nations as well," explains principal investigator Dr.William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipidmetabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University.     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized thefood and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, whilesimultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism. These native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the SierraMadre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras havecoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronaryheart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, isvirtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the nameTarahumara means "fleet of foot," reflecting a tribal passion for betting on"kickball" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or morewhile kicking a machete-carved wooden ball     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas,and pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water,together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humarasalso eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food containsapproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69percent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigatorin the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients whilelow in cholesterol and fat     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL,low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-densitylipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those valuesare in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevatedcholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heartHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199disease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies theTarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, althoughable to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDLcholesterol.     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator MariaTeresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission schoolbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Foodwas weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under theinvestigators' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only foodstipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly,and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory forcholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurementsincluded participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness. Thirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, werefed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an "affluent" diet.     "In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40percent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet thatmany Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low infiber," elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected inthe cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitianSonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  "The CSI is a single number thatincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat inthe diet.  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterollevel, particularly the LDL," Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran dietaverages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor\'s "affluent" diet used in the studyranks a CSI of 149.     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance ofestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, beforeexposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relatingdietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, orplateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fatand/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  "Youmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to putinto the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did notdiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart diseasebecause the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating ona plateau," Dr. Connor says.     After 5 weeks of consuming the "affluent" diet, the subjects\' mean plasmacholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDLfraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent,and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceridelevels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain inweight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon,yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35days.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrializednations.  "We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amountof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolicstudy.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietarycholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption. In the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the totalcalories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflectsthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietarycholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increasedquite a bit in this study," Dr. Connor explains     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor ofcoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts offat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans becauseof their usual high fat intake.     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20percent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSIaround 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low inmeat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recentsuggestions that Americans adopt a "Mediterranean-style" diet.  "The originalMediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake offat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot ofmeat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching toolive oil is not going to help the situation."     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on theemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societiesundergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heartdisease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a differentdiet than the average citizen.  "If the pattern of afluence increases, theentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease,which places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like thedeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they canconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on publichealth measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying forunnecessary, expensive medical technology," Dr. Connors says     "The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily movetheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within avery short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronaryheart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 yearsago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly," he concludesHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::                             General Announcment:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93Unless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge bycalling the NCI's Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.
