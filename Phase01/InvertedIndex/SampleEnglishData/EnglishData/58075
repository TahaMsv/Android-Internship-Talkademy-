We always came homwith a nasty case of jiggers (large red bumps where the buggers haburrowed into the skin). My mother would paint the bumps with cleafinger nail polish. This was repeated daily for about a week or so. Thapplication of the polish is supposed to suffocate them as it seals othe skin. All I can say is it worked for us. One word of cautiothough. Putting finger nail polish on a jigger bite stings like hell(If I do get flamed for this just put jam in my pockets and call mtoast.:-______________________________________________________________________________kentcomm!jperkski@aldhfn.akron.oh.us (and) kentcomm!jperkski@legend.akron.oh.u
