Does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly?  Doesshort-term use of the drug ever produce long-term side-effects aftethe use of the drug?  My grandmother recently had to be hospitalizeand was given large doses of haldol for several weeks.  Although thdrug has been terminated, she has changed from a perky, slightlsenile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyonand who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance.  Iseems incredible to me that such changes could take place in thcourse of just one and one-half months.  I have to believe that thcombination of the hospital stay and some drug(s) are in parcatalysts for this.  Any comments--Will Estes\t\tInternet: westes@netcom.co
