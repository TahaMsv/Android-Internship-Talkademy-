My (then) wife used to get recurrent yeast infections. One day, hedoctor sent her home with medication for her and a pill for me. I toothe pill, upon her insistence, and was very relieved the next day when looked it up in the PDR. It only RARELY causes testicular atrophy..Anyway, men apparently do get yeast infections
