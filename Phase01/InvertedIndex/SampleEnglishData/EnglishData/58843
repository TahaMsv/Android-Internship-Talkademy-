I may not be allergic but I don't want to take the chanceI don't react to scallops, but did have discomforts with clam juicserved at (American) waterfront seafood bars.  I don't know whethethe juice is homemade or from cansThe following is my first encounter with the Chinese RestauranSyndrome.  Ten years ago, about an hour after having Won Ton Soup collapsed in a chair with my face feeling puffed up, my scaltingling, my feet too weak to stand up.  The symptoms lasted for abou20 minutes.  Determined to find out the cause of my first reaction, went back to the Chinese restuarant and ordered the same dish.  Thsame thing happened.  A quick look inside the kitchen revealed nothinout of the ordinaryI've also had a mild attack after having soup at a Thai restuarant
