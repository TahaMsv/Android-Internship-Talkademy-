Ihave had a frozen shoulder for over a year or about a year.  It is stilpartially frozen, and I am still in physical therapy every week.  But thpain has subsided almost completely.  UNTIL last week when I mowed thlawn for twenty minutes each, two days in a row.  I have a push type powemower.  The pain started back up a little bit for the first time in quita while, and I used ice and medicine again.  Can anybody explain why thiparticular activity, which does not seem to stress me very much generallyshould cause this shoulder problemThanksAlic
