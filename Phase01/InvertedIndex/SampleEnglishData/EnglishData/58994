As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previouquestion "WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?" I must assumthat my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it wasShe believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of iand not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, shebelieves that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict. (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get thidea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of thefood, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSbe considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habiforming) This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (mchildren's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pefood. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any othebrand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, somsort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, areDoes the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pefood to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put inpet food----------------------------------I speak for myself and not Motorol------------------------------------Walter Lundb
