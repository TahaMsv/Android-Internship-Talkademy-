Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide, so a product of ithydrolysis is going to be methanol, which can then be oxidized tformaldehyde.  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion oaspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noisesince you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from othecomponents of food all the time.  In studies involving administratioof high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectableMethanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisoningssay 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehydand formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levelcan damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high dosethe body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, ontreatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk oethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol imetabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liverIf the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehydeit is actually relatively non-toxic--Steve Dyedyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dye
