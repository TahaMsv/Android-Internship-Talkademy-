Huey) writes\t   I am looking for any information/supplies that will allo   do-it-yourselfers to take Krillean Pictures. I'm thinkin   that education suppliers for schools might have a appartus fo   sale, but I don't know any of the companies. Any info is greatl   appreciated\t   In case you don't know, Krillean Photography, to the best of m   knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organi   object between charged plates. The picture will show energy pattern   or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what typ   of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One migh   extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object withi   the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signatureThere have been a number of scientific papers (in peer-reviewed journalspublished about Kirlian photography in the early 1970s.  Sorry I can't bmore specific but it is a long time since I read them.  They would describwhat is needed and how to set up the apparatus. These papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography cabe completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on thmoisture in the object being photographed.  It has nothing to do with th"energy signature" of organic objectsI did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high schoolI was able to obtain wonderful auras from rocks and pebbles and the like bfirst dunking them in waterBarbar--bls101@syseng.anu.edu.a"I generally avoid temptation unless I can\'t resist it."                - Mae West
