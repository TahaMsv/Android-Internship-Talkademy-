     I am doing a term paper on steroids, actually the scientist whhelped crate the drug. I discovered that Joseph Fruton is one of thresearchers who helped create anabolic steroids. The only information onthis person I know is he was a biochemist that did research in the 1930'sI already did research at my local libraries, but I still need morinformation. My instructor is requiring resources from the computenetworks. Please write back concerning my subject, any books, articlesetc., will be appreciated.
