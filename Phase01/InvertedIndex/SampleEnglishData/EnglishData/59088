FYI...I just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response twhat the group is for.....A note to the users of alt.psychoactives...This group was originally a takeoff from sci.med.  The reason fothe formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactivdrugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics, Prozac, Lithium,etc)antipsychotics(Melleral(sp?), etc), OCD drugs(Anafranil, etc), anso on and so forth.  It didn't take long for this group to degeneratinto a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere.  That's to bad, for most of thserious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place havleft and gone back to sci.med, where you have to cypher throughundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive dataIt was also to discuss real-life experiences and side effects othe above mentionedOh well, I had unsubscribed to this group for some time, and I decideto check it today to see if anything had changed....nope....same olnine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended forI think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without ibeing moderated...too badOh well, obviously, no one really caresBill ClausseWould anyone be interested in starting a similar moderated groupBill Clausse
