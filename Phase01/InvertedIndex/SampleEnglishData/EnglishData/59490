Not all kidney stones have calcium and notall calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  But the vast majority are calciumoxalate.  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.  I cited that NEJM articleas a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group thatconventional wisdom is used in medicine, always has been and probablyalways will be.  If one uses conventional wisdom, there is a chance thatyou will be wrong.  As long as the error is not going to cause a lot ofdamage, what's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti-fungals tosinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack?)On the kidney stone problem.  I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinicalchemistry lab.  Balance is much more important than the dietary intake ofcalcium.  I know that you use an electrical conductance technique tomeasure mineral balance in the body.  I know that you don't think that theserum levels for minerals are very useful(I agree).  If I can get a goodnutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissuereserve for minerals, I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to seehow your technique compares with mineMarty B
