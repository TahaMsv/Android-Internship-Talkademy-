>...I\'m not asking anyone here to buy into "The Yeast Connection" boo>because I don't know what's in that book, plain and simple. And to be hones>with you, I'm beginning to wish that it was never writtenI agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the wait was.  My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to thpossibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back i1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the boobecause 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly writtefrom a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand, my doctor has always kepan open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the "yeasconnection"But, I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the righclinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  Ithe meantime, I\'d still encourage people who have "incurable" chronic sinuproblems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor tadminister a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along witliver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).  Iis an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ENsays "sorry, you\'ll just have to live with it", it is time to step out antry an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidenc(Dr. Ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  Athis stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole anhave the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensivclinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal witrelatively healthy (i.e., non-AIDS) patients.  I'm glad I did this, since saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole).  Ocourse, your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may nowork for you.
