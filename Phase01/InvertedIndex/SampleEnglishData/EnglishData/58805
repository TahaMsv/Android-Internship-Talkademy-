My mom has just been diagnosed with cystic breast disease -- a birelief, as it was a lump that could have been cancer.  Her doctor sayshe should go off caffeine and chocolate for 6 months, as well astopping the estrogen she's been taking for menopause-related reasonsShe's not thrilled with this, I think especially because she just gavup cigarettes -- soon she won't have any pleasures left!  Now, I thoughI'd heard that cystic breasts were common and not really a health riskIs this accurate?  If so, why is she being told to make variousacrifices to treat something that's not that big of a dealThanks for any information-- Chri--black@sybase.coNote:  My mailer tends to garble subject lines.
