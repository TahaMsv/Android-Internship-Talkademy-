Of course, they arworking on the theory that candida overbloom with penetration into mucumembrane tissue with associated "mild" inflammatory response can and doeoccur in a large number of people.  If you reject this "yeast hypothesis"then I'd guess you'd view this research as one more wasteful and quixotiendeavor.
