It describes the necessary equipment an suppliers for the Tesla coil or alternatives, the copper plate ansetup. I used a pack of SX-70 film and removed a single pack in dark room, then made the exposure, put it back in the film pack anran it out through the rollers of the camera forinstant developinand very high quality.  It is a good way to experience what KirliaPhotography is really and what it is not.  As you know all readyit is the pattern in the bioplasmic energy fieldthat is significantVariations caused by exposure time, distance from the plate, opressure on the plate, or variations in the photo materials are noimportantHard copy mail; Mark C.
