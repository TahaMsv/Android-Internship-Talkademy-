This question came up in Sci. Med. Nutrition and I'm posting my answerhere.  Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on humannutrition.  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can dowhen candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical communityI think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing themark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS.  So many women(andtheir husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal thatmost physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused bydiet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.

PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, mostphysicians don\'t recognize it as a specific "disease" entity.  Here iseverything that you would ever want to know about PMSPremenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups\tPMT-A(Anxiety)\t\tPMT-D(depression\tanxiety\t\t\tdepressio\tirritability\t\tforgetfulnes\tinsomnia\t\tconfusio\tdepression\t\tletharg\tPMT-C(Craving)\t\tPMT-H(Hyperhydration\tcraving for sweets\tweight gai\tincreased appetite\tbreast congestion and tendernes\tsugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tendernes\t 1. headache\t\tedema of the face and extremitie\t 2. palpitation\t 3. fatigue or faintinPMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and lowprogesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cyclePMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simplecarbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there isincreased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucosechallenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C area low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemiais not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes ofhypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia\tA. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990)Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesiumsupplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% ofthe total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sourcesof alpha linoleic acidPMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midlutealphase of a women's cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be leadtoxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midlutealphase).

"Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for\t    a nutritional approach". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine.\t    J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986\tB. "Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension\t    syndromes", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983)\tC. "Premenstrual tension", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you canfind a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding onethat will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work,supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There reallyhas been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candidablooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimentalcontrolled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like tosee done)Here are a few of these studies\tCARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, "Effect of a low-fat,\thigh-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy" Lancet\t2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy\tof at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive\tspecific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories\tand increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary\tadvise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant\treduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in\tthe trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as\tphysical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling,\ttenderness and nodularity\tVITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, "The use of Vitamin A in\tpremenstrual tension" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960). \t218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU\tvitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored\tand high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of\ttoxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the\tstudy was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool\tsize(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this\tnormal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose\tvitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10%\tgetting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms  \t10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS\tsymptoms\tExperimental Controlled Study, "Premenstrual tension treated with\tvitamin A" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts\treceived 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their\tcycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms  \tAfter 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in\tPMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of\ttoxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year\tafter high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms\tdid not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the\tvitamin A supplementation was stoppedMost Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver. These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normalstore of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitaminsgiven for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the bestsingle effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid(estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver fullof vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to preventthe symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be tryingto do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitaminA toxicity\tVITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, "Pyridoxin\t(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover\ttrial"J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49\twith moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo  \tAfter 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another\t3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of\tPMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS\twere not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation\tExperimental Double-blind Study, "The efects of vitamin B6\tsupplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms" Obstet. Gynecol\t70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received\t150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence\tshowed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related\tto the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as\tbehavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction  \tAnxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6\tsupplementationVitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth controlpills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man. Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 perday.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R.Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted inClin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should beconsidered the "first-line" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if thepatient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  VitaminB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more eachday.\tVITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Efficacy of alpha\ttocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome" J. Reprod.\tMed. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3\tcycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a\tsignificant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast\ttenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significan \treduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38%\thad a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo\tgroup.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significan\tdecrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group\tExperimental Double-blind Study, "The effect of alpha-tocopherol on\tpremenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study" J. Am. Coll. Nutr.\t2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly\treceived vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After\t2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly\timproved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly\timprove PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-\t(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve\tPMT-H symptoms)\\tMAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Magnesium prophylaxis\tof menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium" Headache\t31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg\tdaily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a\tplacebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and\tcontinued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index\twas significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment\twas also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual\tDistress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in \tlymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower\tin this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer\tfrom PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised\tinto the normal range\tExperimental Double-blind Study, "Oral Magnesium successfully\trelieves premenstrual mood changes" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991).\t32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid\t360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the\tonset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received\tmagnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster\tpain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the\tmagnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were\tswitched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on\tthe Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by\tmagnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium\tsupplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes\tthat occur during PMSThere are numerous observational studies that have been published in themedical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorderthat arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  Butsince observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med.to be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There arealso over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done onmultivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen thebest specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point outthat PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognizenutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri,pellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctorbeing trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMSis really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritionaldisorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the rosesHere's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineralsupplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS\tExperimental Study, "Effect of a nutritional programme on\tpremenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis", Complement. Med.\tRes.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and\tsupplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E,\tmagnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to\ttake the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate\tdiet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an\timprovement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that\tthey no longer suffered from PMS.\tExperimental Double-blind Study, "Role of Nutrition in managing\tpremenstrual tension syndromes", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987). \tA low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite\tsupplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet\tchange and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the\tvitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased\testradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel\tphase of their cycle\tExperimental Double-blind Study, "Clinical and biochemical effects\tof nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome", J.\tReprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12\ttablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a\tsignificant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Anothe \tgroup of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this\tsecond group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on\tPMS symptoms was observedMartin Banschbach, Ph.DProfessor of Biochemistry and ChairmaDepartment of Biochemistry and MicrobiologOSU College of Osteopathic Medicin1111 W. 17th StTulsa, Ok 7410"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there isno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance"
