Where does the smoke flavor come from>>2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel colo>    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavorin>    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injecte>    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive>    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still bein>    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what>>3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicate>    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extrac>    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whateve>    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey te>    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to d>    so>>WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens)>I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tang>taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recentl>stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips>getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process>then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips>>My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weigh>stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sor>of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time afte>the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff>just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct>>I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat drippin>on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and becaus>it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only gril>non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like thi>duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coal>at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on th>floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fir>in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals>>And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is tha>smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contain>nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.

One charcoa>broiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 DuncansI don't understand the assumption that because something is found tbe carcinogenic that "it would not be legal in the U.S.".  I think thanaturally occuring substances (excluding "controlled" substances) arpretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food, food additiveor other "consumption".  It\'s only when the chemists concoct (sp?) aingredient that it falls under FDA regulations.  Otherwise, if theyreally looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everythingHow in the world do you suppose it\'s legal to "consume" tobacco product(which probably SHOULD be banned)\tDave Alle\tSpace Science & Engr.
