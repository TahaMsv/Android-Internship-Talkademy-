Does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine, or the two icombination, can reduce the body's ability to make use ofavailable water?  I had kind of an odd experience on a group hikrecently, becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorouhiking despite having brought 1 1/2 gallons of water (c. 6 liters)I drank close to twice as much as anyone else, and no one else wadehydrated.  I don't think general physical condition was an issuesince I was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of generastamina, so far as I could tellIt may be that I just plain need more water than most people.  But I awondering if theophylline and/or ephedrine might be aggravating thingsI took a couple of Primatene tablets during the hike to control asthm(24 mg. ephedrine, 100 mg. theophylline).  I gather that both thosdrugs are diuretics.  So now I'm wondering: does that mean they careduce the body's ability to utilize available water?  Would it be particularly  stupid thing to take that medication during hot-weatheexercise?  (I always assumed diuresis just meant you urinated a lot, buthat wasn't the case yesterday.
