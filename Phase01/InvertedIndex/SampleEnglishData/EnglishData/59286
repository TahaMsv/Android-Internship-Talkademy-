Fordham)     The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive surgeon to  patient isextremely low, provided that the surgeon strictly  adheres to universalinfection control procedures, write C.  Fordham von Reyn et al. of theDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performedinvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positivefor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing,representing 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeonperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients weretested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  Allpatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery. The examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detectcases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost ofthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the singlemost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37percent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing wereconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon whowas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study. Notifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptiveand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\       =================================================================    "Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIVInfected Surgeon" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 3Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.)     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will bequantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similarinvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns HopkinsUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified atotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical procedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon waslisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed forall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates wereobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413had  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. Nostudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newlydetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probablyinfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369person-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission topatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hoursof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-controlguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose tobe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person wasfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probablythe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result, there is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positivesurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude.      =================================================================                                April 20, 1993      ================================================================= "Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10 (Kolata, Gina)     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highlyunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs areundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of theMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  Hesaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as ithad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effectivein fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful thatHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation atdifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all themutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or oneafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companiesdo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The newagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety dataon new AIDS drugs.  "An  agreement like this will greatly facilitateHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 3Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199companies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in amuch more  efficient way," said Scolnick.  He also said that the collaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement,Merck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP. Dr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Instituteof Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, "We\'re delighted to see the pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing theinformation flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds forAIDS."

AZT has been used in the United  States in asymptomatic HIV-positive people onthe basis that  administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of T-cell counts.  However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT shouldnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877people given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receivingonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that theproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even todeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The conclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infectedindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for theprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the studyof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have alreadyappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the evidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count hasproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIVinfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from thebeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress ofdisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itselfprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes Maddox.      =================================================================="Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-InfectedWomen" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippeet al.)     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgMtype in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission ofHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of theHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 4Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199National AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesizedthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the presence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances inbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women wereenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6months, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM wereassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with protein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viralgenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets ofprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months postpartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97percent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent;and IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survivedlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack ofpersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1infected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive ofHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis. The  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgMresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 inbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchersconclude.      ==================================================================                                   April 21, 1993      ==================================================================   "Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture" Journal of Commerce(04/21/93), P. 7A     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announcedTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDSresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIVinfection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarilyfrom the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapiessince  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individualAIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories,led the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to cometogether, said participants.  In  addition to Merck, the other companiesinvolved in the  Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo Inc.,  Hoffman-La Roche,Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Smithkline  Beecham, AB Astra, Du Pont Merck,Syntex Inc., Boehringer  Ingelheim, Miles Inc., and Sigma-Tau.  Theparticipants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development theywere aware  of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively involved in HIV anti-viral development may participate.  Scolnick said thecollaborators would most likely meet every couple of  months for a daylongscientific meeting where they will review  for one another their preclinicalHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 4Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199and early clinical data.  The  American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR)was pleased with  the news of the collaboration, which it hopes will lead tothe  development of drug combinations that will reduce viral  resistance.

Following recent  highly publicized reports ofhealth professionals who contracted  HIV, the department issued revisedguidelines on the management  of such cases.  Dr. Kenneth Calman, ChiefMedical Officer, said  doctors, dentists, nurses, and other health-careworkers have an  ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to HIV infection, including, if appropriate, diagnostic HIV testing.  He said,"Infected health care workers should not perform invasive  procedures thatcarry even a remote risk of exposing patients to  the virus."
