Set the follow-u(line in the header, depending on what kind of advice you give, o(e-mail directly to me: ceci@lysator.liu.se.I have a problem with wasps -- they seem to love me. Last summer couldn't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my gardebefore one or several wasps would come for me. I am asking for advicon how to repel wasps   This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to onof my tiny ponds. The caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take carof them, and that will give me a head start on them. Last year wcouldn't find any nest. Even after the caretaker has gassed the nesin my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely vifor the territory. Is there anything I can grow, rub on my skin ospread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastardsNever mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloveplants, I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyonelse   Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath? The wasps seeto come to drink at them, and I suppose that their prey will breed ithem. The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps, because as sooas the wasp season starts, they stop coming to have their bathEven when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps, theseem to love me. The advice I usually get when I ask what to do abouwasps, is to stand still and not wave my arms. I've got some painfustings when trying to follow that advice. I have also tried to ushygienic products without perfumes, to no avail. They still love meand come for me, even when I'm in the middle of a crowd. So far onltwo things seem to work: To kill it dead or to run into the house anclose all doors and windows.NB: I don't have a problem with bees or bumble-bees, just wasps    Patronizing advice redirected to /dev/null--Cec-=====ceci@lysator.liu.se=========================================="The number of rational hypotheses that can explain any give phenomenon is infinite.Phaedrus' law from RM Pirsig's _Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance
