Itpleased my family no end, since I'm at an Osteopathic school, sort ofvalidated it for them...then I told them that the name was the same but thepractice was different....oh\tIf you're seeking validation for your philosophy on the strength ofthe national health service adopting it, I suggest that you are not verysure of the validity of your philosophy.
