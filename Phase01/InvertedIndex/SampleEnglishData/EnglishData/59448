>Could anyone give me information on Umbilical hernias>The patient is over weight and has a protruding hernia>Surgery may be risky due to the obesity>What other remedies could I tryUnless the patient has a very short life expectancy, the possible complicationfrom a hernia that hasn't been repaired far outweigh the risks of surgeryThe risks of surgery, anyway, are minimal.
