Before more bandwidth gets wasted on thisI APOLOGIZE for my flameFirst, because I distributed the message to so many newsgroups; I di       not check the crosspostings of the article I followed up onSecond, for not making my argument clear enough. I reacted to the ton        of many of the anti-Kirlian posts, not to their content. Righ        or wrong, I found the arguments set in arrogant and sneering word        (that includes "jokes"), which I still think is unwarrantedAnd, obviously, I should not have done the same-- Ale
