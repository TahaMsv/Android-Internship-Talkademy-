But doctors who know of an HIV-positive colleague  whohas not sought advice must inform the employing authority and the appropriateprofessional regulatory body.  The guidelines  also emphasize the significanceof notifying all patients on whom an invasive procedure has been done by aninfected health-care  worker.  A model letter to patients who have come intocontact  with such an individual is provided, along with suggestions for health officials on how to deal with the media.  In addition, a  U.K. advisorypanel on HIV infection in health-care workers has  been formed to providespecific occupational recommendations to  those treating such patients.==================================================================   "Properties of an HIV \'Vaccine\'" Nature (04/08/93) Vol. 362, No. 6420, P. 504  (Volvovitz, Franklin and Smith, Gale)     The questions raised by Moore et al. about recombinant gp160  envelopeglycoprotein precursor from HIV-1 produced by  MicroGeneSys are advantagesrather than disadvantages, write  Franklin Volvovitz and Gale Smith ofMicroGeneSys in Meriden,  Conn.  Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirusexpression  system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor, and that this recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV-1 virusdoes in natural infection.  But vaccination with  recombinant gp160 inpatients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1  specific envelope-directed immuneresponses, including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 andCD8  cytotoxic T-cell responses.  Volvovitz and Smith claim that they  neverintended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein.  Antibodyresponses against native HIV-1 proteins,  including the types described byMoore et al., exist in nearly  all AIDS patients but do not preventHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 4Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199progression of HIV disease.  In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120antibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specificactivation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.  The absence of CD4binding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an addedsafety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts,stimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immunefunction.  Based on  these and other clinical results, MicroGeneSys gp160 waschosen  by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the  firstphase III vaccine therapy studies, conclude Volvovitz and  Smith.==================================================================   "HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol.341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline)     There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positivewomen breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.  Theanti-infective properties of  milk are well documented.  While the numbers ofleukocytes,  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation tobarely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three totwelve months, with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA. Breastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratoryillnesses, in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positivemothers.  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) thanbottlefed infants (9.7 months).  Breastfed children also had a slowerprogression to AIDS.  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offerprotection against HIV-1 infection.  Studies of  the biological properties ofmilk from 15 HIV-1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgAantibodies against envelope  glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies againstcore antigens.

If universal precautions are practiced, the risk of HIV  transmissionfrom dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal, write Gordon M.

Theresearchers contacted all  patients treated by a dentist with AIDS andattempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing.  Living patientswith newly detected HIV infection were interviewed, and DNA sequence  analysiswas performed to compare genetic relatedness of their  HIV to that of thedentist.  Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and themedical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drugabuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail. There were  1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124 were deceased.  An examination of the death certificates of  patientsidentified five who had died with HIV infection, all of  whom were eitherhomosexuals or IV-drug users.  The researchers  were able to detect 962 of theremaining 1,048 patients, and 900  agreed to be tested.  HIV infection wasreported in five of the  900 patients, including four who had clear evidenceof risk  factors for the disease.  One patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior.  Comparative DNA sequenceanalysis showed that the viruses from the dentists  and these five patientswere not closely related.  The study  suggests the potential for HIVtransmission from a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a settingin which  universal precautions are strictly observed, conclude Dickinson  etal.       ================================================================                                  April 22, 1993       ================================================================  "AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB, Study Says" WashingtonPost (04/22/93), P.

People who contract TB usuallydevelop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteriaagain.  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fightoff a  new TB infection, doctors found.  Peter M.

In the Lancet's March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesberg's hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead toAIDS, "a hindrance to public health initiatives."   However, their hypothesisthat HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits. The U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy,no prevention,  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on thishypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4 depletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodiesagainst HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexualsfrom Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg's drugAIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drugfree AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT use altogether.  To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would  have toproduce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 yearsHIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the sameAIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.  The 10 year period is claimed by HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 4Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 199proponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS. Alternatively, they could show that HIV-free  individuals who have used drugsfor 10 years never get  AIDS-defining illnesses, concludes Duesberg.================================================================  "Rapid Decline of CD4+ Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV-1  Infection"Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 959   (Vento, Sandro et al.)     Interferon (IFN), which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune  diseasesin some settings, may hasten CD4 T-cell loss in some  HIV-1 infectedindividuals through the amplification of harmful  "autoimmune" reactions,write Sandro Vento et al. of the A.  Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy. The researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals withhepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid, profound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout theobservation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and hadcirculating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients, obtained at theend of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,contained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens,homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41. These autoantibodies, which also  recognize "native" class II molecules andmay contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells "in vivo", were at low tires(50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection andHCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell lossin some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful"autoimmune" reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLAantigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cellcounts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.  IFN can induce a very rapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients withthese HLA haplotypes, the researchers conclude.       ================================================================                                  April 23, 1993       ================================================================   "TB Makes a Comeback" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6  (Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.)     Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  UnitedStates, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS  patients, immigrants,minorities, and prisoners.  Dr. Lee B.  Reichman, professor of medicine at theUniversity of New Jersey  Medical School and president of the American LungAssociation,  said, "Right now, it\'s a big city problem, but potentially it\'s everyone\'s problem."

State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading becausethose who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through withtreatment.  In addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of publichealth services.   In New York City, TB is an epidemic "because the number ofcases  is increasing faster than we can treat people," said Dr. George Diferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control.   According toDiferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more ofdiagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York Cityresidents don't  complete therapy.

The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases insouthern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, writeOkey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta, Ga. The researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastalPalm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexualtransmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users,or  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary routeof HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients,  in addition to recordsfrom social services, HIV counseling and  testing centers, and sexuallytransmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factorwas found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records werereviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmissioncategories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification, thepercentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward countiesbetween January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed toheterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among menand from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.
