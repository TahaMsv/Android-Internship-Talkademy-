[...B >  Marty B Marty, I personally wouldn't be so quick and take that NEJM article on kidney stones as gospel. First of all, I would want to know wh sponsored that study I have seen too many "nutrition" bulletins over the years fro local newspapers, magazines, to TV-guide, with disclaimers on th bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to u compliments of the Dairy Industries There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thriv financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous benefits of increasing one's calcium intake Secondly, were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved in that project analysed for their chemical composition?  The stud didn\'t say that, it only claimed that "most kidney stones are large ly calcium. Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exac opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that the are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldn't be the first time Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention of kidney stones I, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes i one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidne stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREAS in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calciu type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefi from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead     Ron Rot ==================================================================== --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  - * A stone on the ground is better than a stone in the body--   RoseReader 2.10  P003228 Entered at [ROSEHAMILTON   RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-536
