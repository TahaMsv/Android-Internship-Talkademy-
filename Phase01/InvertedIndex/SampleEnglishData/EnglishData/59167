I've had kidney stones 4 timesand I know the pain she is going through.  First, it is best that she seea doctor.  However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and thonly thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for urinary tract infection.  The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stoneare extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable, so we just waited iout.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  Anyway, if shabsolutely won't see a doctor, I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhapan over the counter sleeping pill.  But, I do highly suggest seeing a doctorKidney stones are not something to fool around with.  She should be x-rayedto make sure there is not a serious problemStev
