As I understand, these are all short termI second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to sawhat type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not sahow long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids fomonths before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing areevery other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a startAnother option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to starazathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another druin addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specificabout options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration ofdisease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what iis worth. I treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a goodpatient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so thingcan be put in context.  You should also be a member of the Crohn's anColitis Foundation of America.  1-800-932-2423 office / 1-800-343-363info hotlineBest of Luck to youSteve Hollandgila005@uabdpo.dpo.uab.ed
