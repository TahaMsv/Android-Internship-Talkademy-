Although not many patients with Hep B go on tchronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and isomething to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) mucmore frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also aautimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women whicalso leads to cirrhosis. Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangeroueffects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function.Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comasamong many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepaticirculation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects ohyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis.These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, imen, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment focirrhosis is liver transplantKeep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, iyour friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up thsubject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully hor she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection tyou, and offer you supportSimon.
