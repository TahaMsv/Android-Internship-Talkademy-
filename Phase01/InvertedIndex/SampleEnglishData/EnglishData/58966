Thank you in> advance for all replies.These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of netreatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect byperforming studies that are "blind" in various ways.  Some of thesare  o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a     placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in th     control group or the test group  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects     receive a placebo or the test treatment  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subject     receive a placebo or the test treatmentObviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has todifferentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysiis quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data owhich it is based so that others can verify it. It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects aranimals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results becausthose who performed the study did not "blind" themselves.  It is noconsidered so important to make mice more ignorant than they alreadare, though it is important that in all respects except the one testedthe control and test groups are treated alikeRussel
