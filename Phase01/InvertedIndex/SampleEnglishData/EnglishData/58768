We were talking about Migraine and Exercise (I'm the one who can'fathom the thought of exercise during migraine...).  Anyway, turninthe thread around, the other day I played tennis during my lunchour.  I'm out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise.  got overheated, and dehydrated.  Afterwards, I noticed a tinglinsensation all over my head then about 2 hours later, I could feea migraine start.  (I continued to drink water in the afternoon.I took cafergot, but it didn't help and the pain started althougit wasn't as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night, thpain subsidedThis isn't the first time that I've had a migraine occur after exerciseI'm wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wondewhat triggers the migraine in this situation (heat buildup? dehydration?)I'm not giving up tennis so is there anything I can do (besides get intoshape and don't play at high noon) to prevent thisThanks--*********************************************************************Janet Jakstys         UUCP:{ames,mcdcup}!ntmtv!janeNorthern Telecom      INTERNET:janet@ntmtv.coMtn.
