Fauci, who coauthored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the argument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discoveryindicates that "$1 billion spent on vaccine trials" has been "a waste of timeand money" because the trials were started  too long after the patients wereinfected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College ofVirginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argumentfor  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.

The OAM is a small division ofthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for availableresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will beavailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  forNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraidto become involved in AIDS.  "They have to look successful and there is noeasy answer in AIDS," she said.    There is also a common perception that theOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening,such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  anadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDScommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists'general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemicwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, "The OAM advisorypanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It will take them several years to accept the nature of research."  Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigatorat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, "Here is awonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.

Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attackcauses the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component inthe immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be afactor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.

Scientists previously knew that the naturalkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's research represents the first time scientists have indicated that naturalkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to AnthonyL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tubefindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in thebody.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surfacereceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded thatherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.    ======================================================================                                  April 15, 1993     ====================================================================  "AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor" Journal of theAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert,George and Nordenberg, Dale F.)     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  onlyensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain healthproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellertand Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana,Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga., respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should careabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons forthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It shouldbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, itis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economicdevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations. Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will haveon many developing countries, and the increased need for internationalassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of politicalaggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now thereis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approachto international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS inparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book "Earth in theBalance" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainableinternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve childsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout thedeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically change the future of worldwide health.====================================================================  "AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply" Journal of the AmericanHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 4Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth)     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possiblebefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting lessattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the RockefellerFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert andNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such asmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attentionthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS isreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in mostdeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemicdiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is anotheryear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDSand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burdenbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of arampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because eachindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkleysays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.

Volunteers must be HIVinfected but have no symptoms of HIV disease.HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as "ahopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infectedchildren who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS."Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial "isthe first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delaydisease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick."  If thesevaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about theirtherapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children inthe United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World HealthOrganization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide.The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, whichfunds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trialat nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in theACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and HumanDevelopment.Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults showsthat certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses andHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 4Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchersknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease.The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examinedclosely for other reasons as well.  "This trial will provide the first insightinto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines," saidDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID\'s division of AIDS.  "We need thisinformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can preventHIV infection in children."In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-cityareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic.Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers duringpregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more thana one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growingnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injectiondrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a correspondingincrease in the numbers of infected children.HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults. The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIVdevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  Theseinfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses ofchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptomsleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays.At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or youngerto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and olderparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but nosymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollenliver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immuneregulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study.Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester MedicalSchool, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School ofMedicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medicalofficer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS."We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the childrenfor any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms orfevers, for example, than another," said Dr. McNamara.  "We\'ll also look atwhether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or othersignificant laboratory or clinical effects."

These so-called subunit vaccines, each geneticallyengineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved welltolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults.One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--aprotein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant. Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum isthe only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and DrugAdministration.Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Franciscoand the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, inEmeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plusadjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccinecontains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective inother Phase I vaccine trials in adults.A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with theexperimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone,considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children willbe told what they receive.If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of theexperimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children willbegin.Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for sixmonths--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

Although theHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals'immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIVitself caused the skin disease.Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause diseasewithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of theNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleaguesdescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and HumanRetroviruses.Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since mostanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass thisproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes forHIV as well as their own genetic material.NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouseeggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litterscontained both normal and transgenic animals.Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIVgenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soonafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used anincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer.Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on theirnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skinlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  Noskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates.Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were atype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus cancause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in theanimals.Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed thepresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.

The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immunesystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing theskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said.Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientistsexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIVgenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin. Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved thegenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  Nolesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light.The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. PeterDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and InfectiousDiseases.Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs.Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR;Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney,formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs WellcomeHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 5Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AID                                H H S   N E W                  *******************************************                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE                                 March 4, 199     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwideclinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health careprofessionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIVinfection or AIDS.     The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by aphysician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information ondrugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service isfunded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out ofSan Francisco General Hospital.     Secretary Shalala said, "One goal of this project is to share expertiseso patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary healthcare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reducestreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers andcommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patientswith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience."     Secretary Shalala said, "This clinical expertise should be especiallyhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS incommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available."     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, andit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST)Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answerquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians andhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will beanswered as quickly as possible.     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any questionrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatmentinformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral,literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for healthcare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternatesources of information or materials.     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is takenby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nursepractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient andinpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultantasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, currentmedications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history.

The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of HealthProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, andby the American Academy of Family Physicians.     "When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality ofcare they are able to provide to their patients," said HRSA AdministratorRobert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  "This project will be a great resource forhealth care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve."     "This service has opened a new means of communication between health careprofessionals and experts on HIV care management," said HRSA\'s associateadministrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health ResourcesDevelopment, G.
