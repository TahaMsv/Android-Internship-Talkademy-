It may never be justifiable, but I sometimes do it.  Eveafter I try to show thoroughness with a detailed history, neurologiexamination, and discussion with the patient about my diagnosissalted with lots of reassurance, patients still ask "why can\'t yoorder a scan, so we can be absolutely sure?"  Aunt Millie often getinto the conversation, as in "they ignored Aunt Millie\'s headachefor years", and then she died of a brain tumor, aneurysm, owhatever.  If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for patient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, I'd like to heawhat your magic isEvery once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEGMind you, I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumorbut the patient feels like "something is being done" (as if thhours I spent talking with and examining the patient wer"nothing"), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, it\'s *much* cheapethan CT or MRI, and the EEG brings in some money to my department-- .
