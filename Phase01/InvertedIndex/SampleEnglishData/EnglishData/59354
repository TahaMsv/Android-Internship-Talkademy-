My ENT doctor recommended surgery to fix my sinuses.  I have a very deviatenasal septum (probably the result at least partially from several fractures)One side has approximately 10-15% of normal flow.  Of course I have known thifor years but recently discovered that I suffer from chronic sinus infectiondiscovered during an MRI after a severe migraine.  A CT scan subsequentlyconfirmed the problems in the sinusesHe wants to do endoscopic sinus surgery on the ethmoid, maxillary, frontaland sphenoid, along with nasal septoplastyHe explained the procedure, and the risks.  What I would like to know is ithere is anyone out there who can tell me "I had this surgery, and it helpeme"(I've already heard from a couple who said they had it and it didn'really help them)I am a moderately severe asthmatic.  ENT doc says large percentage see somrelief of their asthma after sinus surgery.  Also he said it is not unheard othat migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relievedI am 42Any relevant information is appreciatedRegardsJay KelleSunnyvale, Californibadboy@netcom.co
