I've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented andemented during hospital stays. In the examples I've seen, drugs werdefinitely involved.My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in thhospital.

It is aaspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. Docs seem to believthat, because they have close control of you, it's quite all right ttake your bodily equilibria into their own hands. That control reducethe chance that the patient will make a mistake, but health carproviders can make mistakes too, and mistakes can be deadly under thoscircumstances.I grant you that sometimes there's no choice.
