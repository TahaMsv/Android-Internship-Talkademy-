If you think you have kidney stones or your doctor tells you that you doDEFINITELY follow up on it.  My sister was diagnosed with kidney stone1 1/2 years ago and given medication to take to dissolve them.  After thafailed and she continued to be in great pain, they decided she haendometriosis.  When they did exploratory surgery, they discovered shhad a tumor, which turned out to be rhabdomyosarcoma -- a very rareand agressive cancer.  I realize this is not what happens in the majoritof cases, but you never know what can happen and shouldn't take chances
