Well, in that case, the cones are indee>color sensitive, contrary to what the original respondent had claimed\tI\'m not sure who the "original respondent" was but treiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum, jusas _rods_ respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum (bluegreein our case, reddish in certain amphibia), just as the hoseshoe cra_Limulus polyphemus_ photoreceptors respond to a certain portion othe spectrum etc.  It is a common misconception to confound wavelengtspecificity with being color sensitive, however the two are nosynonymous\tSo in sum and to beat a dead horse\t(1) When the outputs of a cone are matched for number oabsorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelengththe cone outputs are _indistinguishable_\t(2) Cones are simply detectors with different spectrasensitivities and are not any more "color sensitive" than are rodsommatidia or other photoreceptors\t(3) Color vision arises because outputs of receptors whicsample different parts of the spectrum (cones in this case) ar"processed centrally".  (The handwave is intentional\tI've worked and published research on rods and cones for ove10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can "detect coloris frustrating.
