Bu> if you heard things about MSG, you may think it must be itSurprise surprise, different people react differently to different things. Onslightly off the subject case in point. My brother got stung by a bee. I knohe is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localizeswelling, not anaphylactic shock.
