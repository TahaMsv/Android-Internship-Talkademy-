I posted message like this a few months ago and received no replies, but here iis againIs anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on Epilepsy anseizures?  This would allow us to hold discussions and sharinformation via electronic mail.  I already run a Listserver for twother groups, so the mechanics would be easyIf you are interested, mail me a note.  If I get enough replies, I wilmake it happen and provide you with the detailsBTW, I have also started a database on Epilepsy.  This is part of mresearch on natural language question answering systems.  Users of thiservice are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the prograsearches the database and retrieves its best response.  The technologworks by comparing your question against a set of questions that havbeen seen before.  All new questions that are not answered are recordeand used to improve the systemThis database is still small and sparse, but we are adding neinformation.
