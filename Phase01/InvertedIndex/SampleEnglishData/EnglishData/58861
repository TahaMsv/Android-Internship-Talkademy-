> I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there i> network newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am goin> to describe here.  I have a fourteen year old daugter who experience> a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Froste> Flakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything lik> this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of th> family.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decisio> was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again>> Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she ha> a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I a> embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every onc> in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think "Oh, oh, this is th> same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure."  Ten> minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposur> to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure......My daughter has Epilepsy and I attend a monthly parent support groupJust Wednesday night, a mother was telling how she decided to throall the junk food out and see if it made a difference in her 13 year-old'seizures.  He was having about one seizure per week.  She reported thashe did this on Thursday (3/11), he had a seizure on Saturday and thewent 4 weeks without a seizure!!  On Easter he went to Grandma's and atecandy, pop - anything he wanted.  He had a seizure the next day.  Shesees sensitivity to nutrasweet, sugar, colors, caffine and corn.  Witcorn she says, he gets very nervous and aggresive. With my own daughter (age 7) , I think she is also sensitive and stayaway from those foods on her own.  She has never had gum, won't eacandy, prefers an apple to a cookie, doesn't like chocolate and won'even use toothpaste!!!  Her brother, on the other hand, is a junk fooaddict! Hope this helps.  Good Luck
