Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctorLast Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knifeI took him to a local "Urgent and General Care" clinic at 5:50 pm.  Theclinic was open till 6:00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told thedoctor that we were there, and came back and told us the doctor would notsee us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayedhere.  During the next few minutes, in response to my questions, with severaltrips to the back room, the receptionist told me\t- the doctor was doing paperwork in the back\t- the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on goin\t  to the emergency room\t- the doctor would not even speak to me\t- she would not tell me the doctor's name, or her own name\t- when asked who is in charge of the clinic, she said "I don\'t know.I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room, buI was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want tbe bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  I'm stilltrying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them aletter.   We will certainly never set foot in that clinic again------------------------------------------------------------------------Mary Ryan\t\t\t\tmryan@stsci.edSpace Telescope Science InstitutBaltimore, Marylan
