The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visitsfor asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution. The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemedunsafe under federal air quality laws.      "People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend toexacerbate that inflammation," said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the EnvironmentalProtection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  "When people are onthe threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them overthe edge."     The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visitswith daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameterof 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous becausethey are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out ofcompliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.      In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found atlevels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone withasthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.      The findings were published in the April American Review of RespiratoryDisease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the LungAssociation's medical section.      The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest thatparticulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 studyby Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particlesmay be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States. Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptomsand bronchitis in children.      "Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,"says Dr. Schwartz.  "But more and more research is showing that particles arebad actors as well."      One problem in setting, standards for particulateair pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulatedpollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complexand varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, andHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199acid aerosols.      "Researchers can\'t Put people in exposure chambers to study the effectsof particulate air pollution," says Dr. Schwartz.  "We have no way ofduplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  " Consequently, most of whatis known about particulates has been learned through population-based researchlike the Seattle study.      Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfurdioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard anytime soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people withasthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles     "In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports onlycover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that'srarely particulate matter," says Dr.  Schwartz.  "However, PM10 doesn\'t haveto be near its violation range to be unhealthy.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 3Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199               NIH Consensus Development Conference on MelanomThe National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference onDiagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts indermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillancetechniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health careprofessionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histologicalcharacteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management,and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic neviand their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening inpreventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days ofpresentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panelweighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is adistinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;(2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potentialfor long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgicalexcision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections andextensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at highrisk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;(5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk formelanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) educationand screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortalityfrom melanoma.A copy of the full text of the consensus panel's statement is available bycalling the NIH Office of Medical Applications of Research at (301) 496-1143or by writing to:  Office of Medical Applications of Research, NationalInstitutes of Health, Federal Building, Room 618, Bethesda, MD 20892HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 3Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199                         NCI-Designated Cancer CenterThe Cancer Centers Program is comprised of 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centersactively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancerincidence, morbidity, and mortality.  Within the program, there are four typesof cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarilyin basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus onclinical research; "comprehensive" cancer centers (28), which emphasize amultidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and communityoutreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancerprevention and control research.Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it wasthe National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 newcancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passageof the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadenedthe scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, andcancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grewprogressively.In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteriafor comprehensive status.To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, aninstitution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newlyestablished in 1990, the eight criteria for "comprehensiveness" include therequirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research inseveral scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strongprogram of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findingsinto clinical practice.Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantlybeyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (alsoreferred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supportingthe infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompassstrong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and importantoutreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety ofsources.The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics andcapabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploitimportant new findings or address timely research questions.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 3Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199Of the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type. These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centersengage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigatorsand in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applicationsfrom new discoveries in the laboratory.Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research andclinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequentlyincorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into theiroverall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquelystructured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention andcontrol research.  These centers interface with state and local public healthdepartments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective preventionand control techniques from their research findings to those institutionsresponsible for implementing population-wide public health programs. Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations withinstitutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate communityhospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work towardcreating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and throughinterdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from thelaboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.Comprehensive Cancer Centers (Internet addresses are given where available)University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer CenteBasic Health Sciences Building, Room 101918 University BoulevarBirmingham, Alabama 3529(205) 934-661University of Arizona Cancer Cente1501 North Campbell AvenuTucson, Arizona 8572(602) 626-637Internet:  syd@azcc.arizona.edJonsson Comprehensive Cancer CenteUniversity of California at Los Angele200 Medical PlazLos Angeles, California 9002(213) 206-027HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 3Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199Internet:  rick@jccc.medsch.ucla.edKenneth T.

Thedecision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped totest a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes ofHealth, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on thetherapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companiesincluding Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIHthat they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing isintended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week'sreports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of theMicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time. "The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in thenext 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project," said Shalala.  Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. BernadineHealy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler hadconvinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be testedsimultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test ofmultiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by twoyears==================================================================   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 4Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199"The Limits of AZT\'s Impact on HIV" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.114, No. 14, P. 18     AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  wasapproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of thedrug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported thatalthough HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower riskof  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings ofthe three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue thedrug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patientsexperience  little improvement in their illness before the development of AIDS symptoms.
