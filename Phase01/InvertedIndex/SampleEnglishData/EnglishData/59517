While I was a student, I had doctors removrather surprising amounts of wax from my ears by flushing them out a coupltimes, usually because they were examining my ears for some other reason, ansaid something like "Gee, you\'ve got a lot of wax in there".  In my caseremoval of these large wax buildups did noticeably improve my hearing, anI've since gotten in the same habit as your wife of flushing them out witwarm water from a little rubber bulb every few months.  You can buy littlbulbs together with ear drops for this express purpose from the drug store I don't notice that the drops accomplish much of anythingOne question I do have - a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocatea drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remainintrapped water - said he told swimmers to do this after swimming, too.  Iworks, but it stings like the devil, so I've always been content to let anwater in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to geout by itself if shaking my head a few times won't do the trick.
