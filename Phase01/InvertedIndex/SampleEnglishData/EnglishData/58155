I still believthat doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I woulnot have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spenthe many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have doneAnd 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine thatwould help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thangoodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicinthat helps me. I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That yowould go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a seconopinion, and then move on with your lifeJust as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists inthis field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnosesThese are the top names, the ones that people come to from all ovethe country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Gointo a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) washelpful for a while, but after a point, I found it verunproductive.  It was much more productive to do library researchmake phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myselfA recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of whaI'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's noa put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors aronly human and can only do so much.  But there are those of uout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missinpiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticedI guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird thingthat is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heartor failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's becausethose things are much more tangible and have much more concisedefinitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have tdecide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying tfind your way out of itI have chosen the latterLindlindae@netcom.netcom.co>-->--------------------------------------------------------------------------->Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, an>geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.">---------------------------------------------------------------------------
