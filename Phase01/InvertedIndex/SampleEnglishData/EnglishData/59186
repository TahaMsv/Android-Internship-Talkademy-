I can sticit in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, jushave a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pincto get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and istill hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would bbest not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Althougsome suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to preventirritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep,wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in thpuncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevenirratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way tdo this is use a little round bandage and put it over thespot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spotand spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 " apart.This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.  (I havdiabetes and have to take an injection every morning.\t\t\tLater\t\t\t\tDavi--David HahUniversity of Wisconsin : Milwaukeehahn@csd4.csd.uwm.ed
