My wife had hives during the first two monthof her pregnancy.  My son (3 months old), breast-fednow has the same symptoms.  She has been to a skin-specialistbut he has merely prescribed various medicines (oneach visit as though by trial and error :-)Anti-histamines worked on both of them, but looks likbecoming less effectiveAre there other solutions?
