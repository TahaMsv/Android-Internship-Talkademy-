This is to followup my previous reply on this topic, which it has beepointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots1.  I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used    to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is    misleading.  It is not often found effective, particularly by itself    Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of dru    therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute    it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where thi    distinction becomes important2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible\tdiagnostic marker.  However, this might look like somethin\tpeople associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable o\tunpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with OCD. \tOne of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individua\tcan and does suppress some of their 'impulses,' although the\tare an unending source of anxiety. \tThe obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with\tOCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer t\ta superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part\tSome references (one non-technical and several technical\tthat someone was kind enough to supply for m\tbut was unable to post themself |"The boy who couldn\'t stop washing" by judith rapaport.   **\t(technical refs) |\tpharmacotherapy of o-c disorde|\tdonna m jermain and lynn crismo|\tpharmacotherapy 1990; 10(3):175-19|\tepidemiology of oc|\tseteven a rasmussen and jane eise|\tj clin psychiatry 1990;51(2, suppl.):10-1|\tthe waking nightmare: an overview of oc|\tjudith l rapopor|\tj clin psychiatry 1990; 51(11, suppl.):25-2|\tabsence of placebo response in oc|\tmatig r mavissakalian, bruce jones, stephen olso|\tj nerv ment disease 1990 vol 178 no. \tAnd thanks very much to those who supplied constructive \tcriticism to my first post on OCD.  I hope this helps clarif\tthe parts that were misleading\t\t\t\t\t\tkind regards\t\t\t\t\t\ttod+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| Todd I.
