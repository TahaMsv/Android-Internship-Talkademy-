She'd go pale, and sweaty and then vomit copiously.  A couple of usventured a connection with MSG, and her response was: "MSG?  What\'s that?". It also happened when she pigged out on some brands of savoury crackers andchips... which I noticed (later) had MSG on the label.  Don't know aboutdouble blinds, but avoiding MSG has stopped her being sick at restaurantscheers, JohJohn Nash                           | Email: Nash@biologysx.lan.nrc.caInstitute for Biological Sciences,  | National Research Council of CanadaCell Physiology Group.              | Ottawa, Ontario, Canada             *** Disclaimer:  All opinions are mine, not NRC's! **
