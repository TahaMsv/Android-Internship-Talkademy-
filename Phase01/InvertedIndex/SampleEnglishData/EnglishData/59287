You shoul generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the othe major component of the bioflavonoid complex I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after i showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, s there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whol bioflavonoid complex instead I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc.. One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one da for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects  They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they ca be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they ar made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (the are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quit small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven time higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bar extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.    Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are   Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewabl   Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing   Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable   SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowin   Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck   -- Ron Roth - ==================================================================== --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  - *   "Eating Radium has strange results,"  Tom said brightly--   RoseReader 2.10  P003228 Entered at [ROSEHAMILTON   RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-536
