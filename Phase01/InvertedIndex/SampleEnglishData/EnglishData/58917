You're a wonderful speaker and an adept politicianHowever, I believe that all you were asked to do, was simply provide scientifiresearch refuting the work of Olney. I don't think the original poster soughto start a philisophical debate. she wanted some information. Given a littleffort one could justify that shooting oneself with a .45 before breakfast is healthy practice. But we're not particularily interested in what you caverbally prove/disprove or rationalize. Where's the research? Where are thstudiesI appoligize if this sounds flamish.
