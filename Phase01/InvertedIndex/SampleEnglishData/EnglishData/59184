I tend to disagree- I think anecdotal evidence, provided there is a lot of itand it is fairly consistent, will is very important.  First, it points to thnecessity of doing a study, and second, it at least says that the effects arall psychological (or possibly allergy in this case).  As I've pointed outbefore, pyschological effects are no less real than other effects.  One      person\'s "make-believe" can easily be another person\'s reality.  Usingpsychadelic drugs in a bizarre and twisted example, the hallucinations onperson experiences on an acid trip cannot be guaranteed to another person oan acid trip- there is no clinical evidence that those effects are always gointo happen.  Anyhow, that was a pretty lame example, but hopefully I made mpoint- it's all a matter of perception, and as long as someone ingesting MSperceives it as causing bad effects, then s/he can definitely experience thosaffects.  On the other hand, it could just be an allergy to the food it's in,   or something.  Still, anecdotal evidence is not worthless- it's the stuff thaleads to the study being done-Da
