I think Dyer ireacting because it looks to be yet another case of the same olquackery over and over againIt true that current medical knowledge is limited, but do you realizjust HOW MANY quacks exist eager to suck your $$$$. It's playing thlottery at bestIf the results you got were so clear and obvious, would you mintrying a little experiment to see if it is true? It would be quitsimple. Have sugar pills and have real pills.  Take one set for onweek and the other set for another week without knowing which ones arthe real pills. Then at the end of the 2 weeks compare the resultsLet's say you're wife would know which are the real ones. If what yoare experiencing is true there should be a marked difference betweeeach week.joh--John Nielsen   MAGNUS Consultant            ______   ______   __  __\"To you Baldrick, the Renaissance was just /\\  __ \\ /\\  ___\\ /\\ \\/\\ \something that happened to other people,   \\ \\ \\/\\ \\\\ \\___  \\\\ \\ \\_\\ \wasn\'t it?" - The Black Adder               \\ \\_____\\\\/\\_____\\\\ \\_____\
