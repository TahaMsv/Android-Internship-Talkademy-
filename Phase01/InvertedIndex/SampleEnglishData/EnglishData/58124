>Dr. Banks,>\tI don't know if you make a point of keeping up with liver transplan>research but you're certainly in the right place for these questions.  Has>there been anything recent in "Transplant Proceedings" or somesuch, on>xenografts?  How about liver section transplants from living donors?I'm sure the Pittsburgh group has published the baboon work, but don't know where.  In Chicago they were doing lobe transplants froliving donors, and I'm sure they've published.  I don't read thtransplant literature.  I just see the liver transplant patientwhen they get into neurologic trouble (pretty frequent), so thaand the newspapers and scuttlebutt is the way I keep up with whathey are doing.  Howard Doyle works with them, and can tell you more-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, angeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."---------------------------------------------------------------------------
