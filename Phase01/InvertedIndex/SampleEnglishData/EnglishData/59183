GREAT post Martin.

They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS)Oops, that is not a recognized "illness" in the psychological communitybetter not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicianwill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs systemjust e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the generapopulation, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but amonphysicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage any help here a.p.p.er's?One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvioucholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need tcontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they aralso extroverted, they are best described as "Field Marshalls".  This traiis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want tlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledgeto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science antechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientificallyminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other typeand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  Howeverwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the "dark-side" of thipersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to allA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper theitemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling)and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patienmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I'vknown many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige thewith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and theusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is aextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all)Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom>Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have>no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that>balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics...

Of course, I believe that I havbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but beinthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few peoplmyself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussioabove the level of anal effluent>...Humans have all>kinds of different organisms living in the GI system (mouth, stomach, small>and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.

Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinusewere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damagedI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weekof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacteriainfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into thdetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made thidiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of thdifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showea bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help younderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungatherapy below)The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poomucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without beinconsidered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetweeinfection>Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals>and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what>vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling>Elaine's doctor a quackI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, aftemy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, thedropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also receivezinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairlcomplex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomoleculaspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normalhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitaminsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta caroteneCall me carrot face.  :^Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and tall supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, foexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer hagood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-ordeimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably inot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage>survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides>the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  InThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, thaI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in msinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies thademonstrate candida "blooms" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritatio(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after onweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during thitime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting oSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considerenormal)BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can'remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950'which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-seriousaspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinuinflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since iis relevant to this discussion>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus>membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to>the candida or not isn't certainMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergiresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positiveAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this tesis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can gropart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds athreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy tCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membranirritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier postone does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or aPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesisBTW, and I\'ll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, "Sinus Survival"has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemianti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronisinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times ithe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well ove90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but idoesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infectiois not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found thanystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not helpThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom iaggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partwainto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than bdirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admitlots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT whhas to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to starwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will>If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty>nondescript. This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will denand reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until thappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culturthe yeast "bloom" in the gut or sinus, then there\'s no way to diagnose oeven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtuallimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannobe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the bodyIt's a real Catch-22Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say thano studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's noup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study whicshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies shoulbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order tconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their walletsyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence tcompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact studneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even gefunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for thsmaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 othedoctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdoteinto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would genowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical resultsIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they hav*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading tnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenablhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidencto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they woulalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue -excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, wilnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who holsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister..>Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in>the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the>vaginal tract which compete with it for food.

You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, buyou can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemianti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones sucas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as habeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been ie-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the longterm treatment of GI tract "candidiasis".  It\'s like trying to weed a gardeby cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to comout again once you walk awayThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida "bloom" can partiallgrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptomin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming "systemic" in thclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessivbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection thais potentially lethal>In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good>reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very>favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and>humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.

Also, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a priopost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^>If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even>blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.

When I finally find a>doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quackAs I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical systethat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't workFor example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to livwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mentiosurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would noget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive anfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring anequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastlimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deterioratedOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would havimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of thexperience of the three ENT\'s I saw who said that I\'d just have to "live witit".  I\'m confident I will reach what one could call a total "cure".  Thanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that directiobecause of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for thoshaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention aboveBe sure to get the revised edition.>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic>GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his>patients is a non-existent syndromeDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and hivisits to several ENT\'s totally floored him when they said "you\'ll just havto live with it".  He spent several years trying everything - standard annon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He noshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the roato recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history oanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his owpractice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti"yeast hypothesis" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as"it\'s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases", to put it mildlyI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violatintheir moral obligations to help the patientMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and arconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the "hypotheticayeast overgrowth" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast peoplhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenuehave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor doesomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take noticeMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it workinstead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have becomso enamored with "scientific correctness" that they are ignoring the patientthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, whicwe don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point wheyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approac(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after havinexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditionamedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishmentand as a result I have found significant reliefWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set usome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or havinhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubttherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all thaccepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me"well, I\'ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in thicountry, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authoritto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sigsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature othese unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the StatBoard."  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would\'ve jumped on thipronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistireasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with mucrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to thpatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicineand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also woulbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing thcompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everythinit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanisthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some owhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at al(true quackery)I better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size>If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.
