What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearlunderstood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infection- which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections.Marty made this sound like a secret  known only to veternarians anbiochemists.  Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knownthis. At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive bowedecontamination directed at retaining "good" anaerobic flora in an attempto prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group.  I alsuse lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea (that mabe in part due to alterations in gut flora).  However, it is NOT part omy routine practice to "reinnoculate" patients with "good" bacteria afteantibiotics.  I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treatinfungal infections in at risk patients.  Whether or not it is a "logicaextension" from the available observations I\'ll leave to those of you whbase strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence oclinical trials.  One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularlrecalcitrant cases of C. difficile colitis (NOT a fungal infection). Therare case reports of using stool (ie someone elses) enemas to repopulatthe patients flora.  Don't try this at home.>not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.

Wade-J-S.  Lee-J-Y.  Dockery-B-K.  Hain-J-DTI   A randomized, double-blind trial of nystatin therapy for th     candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome [see commentsSO   N-Engl-J-Med.  1990 Dec 20.  323(25).  P 1717-23     psychological tests. RESULTS. The three active-treatment regimen     and the all-placebo regime     significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (P less tha     0.001), but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptom     significantly more than placebo. [ . . .      CONCLUSIONS. In women with presumed candidiasi     hypersensitivity syndrome, nystatin does not reduce systemic o     psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. Consequently     the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for suc     women appears to be unwarranted  Does this trial address every issue raised here, no.  Jon Noring was nosurprised at this negative trial since they didn't use *Sporanox* (despitCrook's recommendation for Nystatin).

There is significant difference between the cost anrisk of these two empiric therapeutic trials.  Are we talking about "realcandida infections, the whole "yeast connection" hypothesis, the efficacof routine bacterial repopulation in humans, or the ability of anecdotalleffective therapies (challenged by a negative randomized trial) to confiran etiologic hypothesis (post hoc ergo propter hoc).  We can't seem tfocus in on a disease, a therapy, or a hypothesis under discussion.                                    I'm lost
