Hi\tI'm an avid dieter and the new miracle drug seems to involve thermogenics. The drug is claimed to stimulate the brown fat to burn foodcreating eat as opposed to the fat being stored. There are all sorts owarnings about fevers, elevated blood pressure and heart rate, ect.\tThe silver lining is that apparently some weight loss does notrequire a change in diet. Is this possible? Are the pills dangerous or jushoaxesKare
