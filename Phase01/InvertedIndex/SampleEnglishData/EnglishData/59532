I have been hearing bad thing about amalgam dental fillings.  Some sathe lead/ mercury leeches into your system and this is bad.  And I havrecently heard that there is some suspicion that the mercury is a breedinground for bacteria that will be resistant to antibiotics.  My dentist wants to use an amalgam filling for me in a place where I havtwo cavaties in one tooth and wants to use one filling to cover bothHe says that composite filling don't hold up well when they are largeSo, I would like to know if there are any other choices besides amalgaand composite.  And, should I really even be worried about amalgam?  heard that some scandanavian country does not even use them any more-is this trueAny information you can give me will be greatly appreciatedThanksDave Child
