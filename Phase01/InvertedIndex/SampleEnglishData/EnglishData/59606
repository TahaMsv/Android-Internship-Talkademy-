     I posted about a "pulse of (relaxation) electricity".  I now thinit more like a pulse of "relaxation" or comfort than a pulse oelectricity.  It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feelinof comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful     Another thing.  When you sleep, you lie down facing up, with youpalms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  Then yorelax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.  Soyou feel a "shiver" below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat)Then this shiver increases, and comes up to your head, and the roam yohear loudens.  (Note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie dowin bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.)  Thiroam is different from the high pitch, but follows the shiver of youbody     "Shiver" is not the word.  It may be called a mild vibration or quakeWhat is this shiver and roam?  Can I use this to induce out-of-bodexperience\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Chung (Mr.), U.S.A
