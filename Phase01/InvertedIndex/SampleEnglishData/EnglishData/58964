My wife and I are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for oufirst child (due June 15th).  We interviewed a young doctor last weeand were very impressed with her.  However, I discovered that she iactually not an Medical Doctor (M.D.) but rather a "Doctor ofOsteopathy" (D.O.).  What\'s the difference?  I believe the pediatricia*I* went to for many years was a D.O. and he didn't seem different froany other doctor I've seen over the yearsMy dictionary says that osteopathy is "a medical therapy that emphasizemanipulative techniques for correcting somatic abnormalities thoughto cause disease and inhibit recovery.Jeez, this sounds like chiropractic.  I remember getting shots anmedicine from *my* pediatrician D.O., and don't remember any"manipulative techniques".  Perhaps someone could enlighten me as tthe real, practical difference between an M.D. and a D.O.
