Okay, this is a long shotMy friend Robin has recurring bouts of mononucleosis-type symptoms, very regularly.  This has been going on for a number of years.  She's seen a number of doctors; six was the last count, I think.  Most of them have said either "You have mono" or "You\'re full of it; there\'s nothing wrong with you."  One has admitted to having no idea what was wrong with her, and one has claimed that it is Epstein-Barr syndromeNow, what she told me about EBS is that very few doctors even believe that it exists.  (Obviously, this has been her experience.)  So, what's the story?  Is it real?  Does the medical profession believe it to be realHas anyone had success is treating EBS?  Or is it just something to live with?  Thanks for your assistanceJoel "The Ogre" Chernejcherney@reed.edOf the Hord
