I love the FAQ.      The comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remainincorrection after RK and possibly after PRK is interresting.  Why ithis?  Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as wellAlso, why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement oonly about 5% of the corneal depth, while RK is done to a depth of up t95%?  Why such a difference?  I thought the proceedures were simmilawith the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK.  I must nobe understanding all of the differencesIn the FAQ, the vision was considered less clear after the surgery thawith glasses alone.  If this is completly attributable to thintentional slight undercorrection, then it can be compensated for whenecessary with glasses (or contacts, if they CAN be worn afterall!).  Iis important to know if that is not the case, however, and some otheconsequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision.  Thfirst thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense, whicglasses couldn't help.would not help--| Daniel R.
