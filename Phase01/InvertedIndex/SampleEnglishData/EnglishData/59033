\tThe reason I'm posting this article to this newsgroup is to1. gather any information about this disorder from anyone who migh   have recently been *e*ffected by it ( from being associated wit   it or actually having this disorder ) an2. help me find out where I can access any medical literature associate   with seizures over the internetRecently, I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hourafter birth. He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Bostoand has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his conditionThis has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only ilearning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing withospitals, procedures...etcI don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termedquite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weighas a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugand that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normalbut the EEG's show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic testsbody structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do noknow quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have aloof evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ). This is wherwe stand right now...If anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as I mentioned up aboveany information relating to this disorder I would sure appreciate hearinfrom you. I am not trying to play doctor here, but only trying to gatheinformation about it. As I know now, these particular types of disorderare still not really well understood by the medical community, and so I'going to see now....if somehow the internet can at least give me alittlinsight. Thanks.
