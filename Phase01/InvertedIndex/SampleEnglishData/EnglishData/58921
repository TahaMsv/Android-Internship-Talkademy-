They lactwo genes. And people who lack one gene are supposed to be 1/56 personsThose with PKU have to avoid naturally occuring phenylalanine. And thoswho only have one gene and underproduce whatever it is they are supposed tbe producing are supposed to be less tolerant of aspartame.The methol, formaldahyde thing was supposed to occur with heatingI don't drink it. I figure sugar was made for a reason. To quickly aneasily satiate hungry people. If you don't need the calories it's just aeasy to drink water.  Used to drink a six pack a aday of aspartame soda. Don'even drink one coke a day when sugared
