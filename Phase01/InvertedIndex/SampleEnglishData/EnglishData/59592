Ordinary massagis intended to make a person feel better, especially if they have musculaor joint problems.  But -- like chiropracty -- there are some practitionerwho take the technique to a far extreme, invoking what seems to me to bquack science to justify their techniqueIn the case of massage, there is a technique called "deep abdominal massagein which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestinesThe notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of thintestines and putrifies, releasing poisons which cause various diseassyndromes.  By this vigorous and painful procedure, it is alleged thathese deposits can be loosened up and passed outI just can't believe this idea has any truth behind it!  The human intestinis not a New York City sewer pipe!  And even if it were, you eat half oa small box of Triscuits, and there ain't gonna be nothin' sticking to thinner surface of your intestine  :-
