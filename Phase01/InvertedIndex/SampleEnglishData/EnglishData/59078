Some patients don't like this and expect, or demandto have something done. In these cases some physicians will "tape" thepatient (put a lot of heavy adhesive tape around the chest), or prescriban elastic binder. All this does is make it harder to breath, but thpatient doesn't feel cheated, because soemthing is being done about thproblem. Either way, the end results are the same=================================Howard Doyldoyle+@pitt.ed
