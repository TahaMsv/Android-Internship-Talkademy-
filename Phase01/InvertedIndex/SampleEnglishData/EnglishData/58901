My family doctor and the physiotherapist (PT) she sent me to agree that thpain in my left shoulder is bursitis. I have an appointment with an orthpo(I love that, it's short for 'orthopedic surgeon, apparently) but while I'waiting the PT is treating meShe's using hot packs, ultrasound, and lasers, but there's no improvemenyet. In fact, I almost suspect it's getting worseMy real question is about the laser treatment. I can't easily imagine whathe physical effect that could have on a deep tissue problem. Can anyonshed some light (so to speak) on the matter--Robert AllisoOttawa, Ontario CANAD
