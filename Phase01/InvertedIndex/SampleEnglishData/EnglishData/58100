"Situs inversus" means that organs are on the wronside of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interestinmedically because the normal location of organs is caused in parby the "normal" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that iabsence of this, laterality can be "random." People with situinversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of theirarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when thecan't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wronside).According to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomarecessive, which should imply that on average one child in fouin a family would be affected. But there may be much more curreninformation on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talkinabout more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask youpediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, owhich there is probably one at NCSU-k
