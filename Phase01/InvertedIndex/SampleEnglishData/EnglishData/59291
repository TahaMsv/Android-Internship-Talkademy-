Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscleexercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitchinarms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers).  However, if exercisalso leads to reduction of body fat, the loss of body fat will be equalldistributed over the entire body.  There is no way to "spot reduce" body faother than surgically, through liposuction. Distribution of body fat igenetically determined.
