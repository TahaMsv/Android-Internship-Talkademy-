Not every wild flight of fancy serve(or can serve) in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis.  It isomewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide aexample of this sort the *only* one they come up with is the one abouKekule.  Surely, there must be others.  But apparently this is regardeas an *extreme* example of a "non-rational" process in science whereba successful hypothesis was proposed.  But how non-rational is itOf course we can't hope (currently at least) to explain how or whKekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tailsSurely it wasn't the *only* daydream he had.  What was special abou*this* one?  Could it have had something to do with a perceive*analogy* between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerningeometry of molecules?  Is such analogical reasoning "extra-scientific"Or is it rather at the very heart of science (Perice's notion of abductionthe use of models within and across disciplines)?  Upon close examinationis there a non-rational mystical leap taking place, or is it perhapcloser to a formal (though often incomplete) analogy or model--Gary H.
