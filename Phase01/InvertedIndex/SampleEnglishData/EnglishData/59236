There are quacks who don't treat and quacks whtreat. One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly.There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones.There are people ahead of their time, with unprobable or unproven theorieand rationals. There are ill-reasoned, absurd, theorists.Sometimes it's hard to tell who's who. Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctorquacks in Babylon.Arguments abound when there aren't any firm answers. Plenty of illnessearen't, or can't, be diagnosed or treated. But I think it's better to arguagainst the theory, as was originally done with postings on candida a montor so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting aopinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody.Sometimes a correct diagnositakes years for people: they don't run into a doctor who recognizes thdisease, they haven't developed something recognizable yet, or they havsomething that no one is going to recognize, because it hasn't beedescribed yet. Sometimes they get a cure, sometimes the illness wears outsometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatmentsometimes they find it's incurable. There is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about anillness. Unless it's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it's imore like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking.-Jackie
