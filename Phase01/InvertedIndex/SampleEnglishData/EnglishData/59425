>I get tired of people saying 'don't eat X becaus>it's BAD!'  Well, X may not be bad for everyone.  And even i>it is, so what?  Give people all the information but don't ra>your decisions down their throatsIt is evident you did not read my post carefully. I wasn'trying to tell you not to eat MSG products and produce, nor was arguing for or against MSG. I was simply questioning the logic oyour statement that simply becaus(a) one is not allergic to something, an(b) likes eating thait follows that one could keep eating whatever it is.In my post, I had clearly said that I don't know enough about MSGThe statement "don\'t eat X because its bad" is just _your_interpretation of nutritional info out therePrakash Da
