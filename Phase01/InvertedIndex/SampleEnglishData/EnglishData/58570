As usual, you are missing the whole point, Russell, because you are nowilling to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, whicis that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highespurpose of science is to avoid making mistakes. This is like saying that the most important aspect of business managemenis accurate bookkeeping. If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, iwould be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  Whawas the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, thmethodology of Jenner and Pasteur? In an earlier article, Russell Turpin writes: >None of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we shoul>open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedo-science>Modern advocates of homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditiona>Chinese medicine receive little respect because, for the mos>part, they use methods and reasoning that the kind of researc>Lee Lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty.

I, in particular, think the basic ideas ohomeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky. What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these thing(including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientifiattention. If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do nouse the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what ieffective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For alof current science is based on the past work of scientists whosmethodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed. It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examinthose results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It ialso true that the results obtained by people today who still rely onthose early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorousfashion by those qualified to do so credibly. But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies icapable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that nideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possiblbe worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude adoctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief ireason. -In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.  lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitne
