Can anyone tell me if a bloodcount of 40 when diagnosed as hypoglycemic idangerous, i.e. indicates a possible pancreatic problem?  One Dr. says no, thother (not his specialty) says the first is negligent and that another blootest should be done.  Also, what is a good diet (what has worked) for a hypoglycemic?
