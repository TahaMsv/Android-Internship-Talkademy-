>> A friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of Crohn'> disease>> But she can't seem to eat certain foods, such as fresh vegetables> without discomfort, and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence>> Her question is: are there any nutritionists who specialize in th> problems of people with Crohn's disease >> (I saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric)>> Thanks in advance> John EyleAll your friend really has to do is find a Registered Dietician(RD).  Whilemost work in hospitals and clinics, many major cities will have RD's whoare in "private practice" so to speak.  Many physicans will refer theirpatients with Crohn's disease to RD's for dietary help.  If you can getyour friend's physician to make a referral, medical insurance should pay forthe RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist.  Thebetter medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend'splan doesn't, it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet tocontrol the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining healCrohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining andlipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation butI'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors.  Forbad inflammation, steroids are used but for a mild case, the side effectsare not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use.  Upjohn is developinga new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal withinflammatory diseases but it's not available yetMarty B.
