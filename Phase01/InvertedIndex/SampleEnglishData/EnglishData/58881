[.......JBJB>  John Badanes, DC, CJB>  romdas@uclink.berkeley.ed   Well, if that's the case in YOUR practice, I have a hard time   figuring out how you even managed to make it into the bottom hal   of your class, or did you create your diplomas with crayons   If someone runs a medical practice with only a 10% success rate   they either tackle problems for which they are not qualified t   treat, or they have no conscience and are only in business fo   fraudulent purposes   OTOH, who are we kidding, the New England Medical Journal in 198   ran the heading: "Ninety Percent of Diseases are not Treatable b   Drugs or Surgery," which has been echoed by several other reports   No wonder MDs are not amused with alternative medicine, sinc   the 20% magic of the "placebo effect" would award alternative   practitioners twice the success rate of conventional medicine..   --Ron---   RoseReader 2.00  P003228: Purranoia: the fear your cat is up to somethin   RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-536
