This will be the first of monthly postings of the newsletter ofthe Long Island Chapter of the Transplant RecipientsInternational Organization (TRIO).  Unfortunately, I was unableto post it before the date of this month's meeting.  I'mposting it anyway, and posting it world-wide instead ofregional, in the hopes that some of the information may beuseful or illustrative.  Also, I hope it can be used as anexample and inspiration for the posting of other newslettersand data related to organ transplantation and donation.

WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALLAST MEETINIt has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter ofTRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, beingable to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance. No TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scoredagain, but we were also able to disable the Long IslandRailroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, manybraved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and goodconversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan,a professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was notable to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall todiscuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman,an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipientwas kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedmangave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup,(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and tominimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicineand drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thankher for an entertaining eveningANNUAL MEETINIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting isalso the Annual meeting of the Chapter.

While we are planning news releases,speaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata andGaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game  because of two year's experience with miserable weather.We all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. Wehave found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publisha letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you toaddress the congregation, or include mention of the gift oflife in his sermon.
