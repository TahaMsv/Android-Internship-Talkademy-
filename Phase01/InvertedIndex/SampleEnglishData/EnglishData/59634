My doc handed me 10mg samples of CLARITIN (brand of Ioratadine Tablefrom Schering Corp.)  I tried to find it in the PDR to no avail. do remember she mentioned this drug was relatively new to the US buavailable overseas for quite some timeLooking mostly for side-effect, contraindications, and mode of actionsuch that it differs from Seldane and HismanalEmail or newsgroup is fine.
