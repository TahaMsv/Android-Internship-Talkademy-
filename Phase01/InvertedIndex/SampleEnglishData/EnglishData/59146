HelloI am interested in trying this "desensitization" (?) methoagainst hay feverWhat is the state of affairs about this. I went to a doctor anpaid $85 for a 10 minute interview + 3 scratches, leading to thdiagnostic that I am allergic to (June and Timothy) grassI believe this. From now on it looks like 2 shots per week fo6 months followed by 1 shot per month or so. Each shot cost$20. Talking about soaring costs and the Health care system, I woulcall that a racket. We are not talking about rare Amazonian grassehere, but the garbage which grows behind the doctor's officeApart from this issue, I was somewhat disappointed to find outhat you have to keep getting the shots forever. Is that rightThanks for informationEj
