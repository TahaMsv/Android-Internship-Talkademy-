I don\'t believe youIn Holland insurences pay for Homeopathic treatment. In Germany they dso as well. I Austria they do if you have a condition which can not behelped by "normal" medicine (happened to me). Switzerland seems to bethe same as Austria (I have direct experience in the Swiss case)At the Univeristy of Vienna (I believe Innsbruck as well) homeopathcan be taken in Med. schoolI found that in combination with Acupuncture it changed my life froliving hell to a condition which enables me to lead a relativelynormal life. I found that modern medicine was powerless to cure mof a *severe* case of Neurodermitis (Note: I mean cure, notsurpress the symptoms, which is what modern medicine attempts todo in the case of Neurodermitis).I'm not saying that Homeopathy is scientific, but that it can offerhelp in areas in which modern medicine is absolutely helplessFrom reading your aritcle it seems that your have some deeply rootebeliefs about this issue (this is not intended to be offensive orsarcastic - it just sounded like that to me) which makes me doubtif you can read this with an open mind.
