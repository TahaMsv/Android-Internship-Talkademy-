A friend of mine has been diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis, as a result otrauma sustained in a car accident several years ago.  The psoriasis is undecontrol but the arthritis part of the illness is notAnsaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years buisn't helping much now.  My friend is now taking Meclomen (another NSAID) buthis isn't helping control the pain at all.  In the past two months my frienhas also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines, but theffects of the combined drugs aren't supposed to be realized for several monthsAs a result of the pain, my friend is having problems sleeping.  Staying ione position too long is an ordeal.  Another major contributor to pain is thatendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base othe palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs).  The tendonitis iquite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatmento relieve itThe latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and inow recommending Prednisone.  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve somof the pain from the tendonitisMy friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he's 80 (his words, not mine)If anyone is aware of any new treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis, alternativcourses of action, support groups or literature on it, I would be extremelgrateful if you could e-mail to me.  If anyone is interested, I'll post summary to this newsgroupthanks in advanceDonndmp@fig.citib.co
