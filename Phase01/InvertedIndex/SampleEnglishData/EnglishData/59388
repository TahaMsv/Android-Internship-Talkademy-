Dear NettersMaybe one of you can explain this.  From time to time I experiencea strange kind of feeling (I have all kinds of weird feelings) whichcan be best described as the feeling of "losing gravity", like that oneexperiences in a descending elevator.  Needless to say, it is notenjoyable.  It sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extremefatigue.  It lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it laststhat long, it makes me sweateningInitially I called it "palpitation (spelling?)" until I later learnt thatthe terminology has been reserved for the self-awareness of heart beatsSo, is there a specific term for this feeling, or am I a stragne personI always believe I am unique.ThanksPin
