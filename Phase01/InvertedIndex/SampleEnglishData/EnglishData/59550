People with early life herniaare felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of herniasThe hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining. However, the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation ishigh enough that it ought to be repaired.  The risk of cancer is probablno higher than the general population, but since you are near 40, it woulbe sensible to have some sort of cancer screening, such as a flexiblsigmoidoscopy.
