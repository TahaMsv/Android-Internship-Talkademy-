As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point MassagerI recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased withthe results.  The catalog description is as follows\tThe Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager\tthat actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like \tprofessional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives tw\tcounter-rotating "thumbs" that move in one-inch orbits -\treleasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms\tPressure Point Massager    A2623   $10To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 ofax at 1-800-345-4021*******NOTEWhen I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the pricwas $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer cataloenclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about itand the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although ilooks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return thfirst one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while tship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I coulduse the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the oldone.  VERY reasonable people*******I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, Iwould be described as "structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretchesand exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away. If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enougtime, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus,more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes requirephysical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visitto get the prescription for p.t. The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headach(sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When myphysical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital musclesin particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), theheadache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell towhile it is being massagedI ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishinsomeone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, myneck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done inthe past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenientp.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get upin the middle of the night and use it, if necessaryI have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The basunit is about a 14" x 9" rectangle, about 3-3/4" high, with handles on eacside, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal "thumbs" are about1-1/2" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2" above the base.  The thumbsare covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located moretoward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move ineither clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which sideof the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from eitheside.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the necor the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it                 ______________________________                |  __    _______________    __                  | |  |  |\t\t|  |  |                 | |  |  |  \\^^/   \\^^/  |  |  |                 | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  |                 | |  |  |\t\t|  |  |                 | |  |  |_______________|  |  |                 | |__|\t\t\t   |__|                 |_______________________________For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (iflaying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/orneck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting ostanding, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists aralso impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and Idon't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down workswell for meFor my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massagebehind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (onot so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place. If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few incheswhenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to usethan the commonly used "home-made" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together(with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine andmove the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better thannothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads arenot in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don'tpin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like thisis to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multipleconsiderations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with itNot only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motionfor my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on mneck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too haragainst it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped. After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point,the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged. I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is themost vulnerable point for meIt also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder bladesalthough, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes aa time) to really work it outI highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've hait such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but alsoto loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I havbeen ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so thiswas very timely  for meThis is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recentlbecame aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have beein business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products andwhile they appear to be more expensive than the average health care cataloproducts, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thoughput into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other oneI\'ve seen such as "Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog" or "Mature Wisdom"I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (nbig surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs,particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefitsI apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ wouldlike to know before ordering something thru the mailRobin Coutellier                  Northern Telecom, Mountain View, CINTERNET: robin@ntmtv.coUUCP:portal!ntmtv!robi
