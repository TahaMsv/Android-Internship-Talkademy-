>>There was a story a few weeks ago on a network news show about some sor>>of fungus which supposedly attacks the bone structure and is somewha>>widespread in California.  Anybody hear anything about this oneThe only fungus I know of from California is Coccidiomycosis.  hadn't heard that it attacked bone.  It attacks lung and if yoare especially unlucky, the central nervous system.  Nothing neabout it.  It\'s been around for years.  THey call it "vallefever", since it is found in the inland valleys, not on the coast-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, angeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."---------------------------------------------------------------------------
