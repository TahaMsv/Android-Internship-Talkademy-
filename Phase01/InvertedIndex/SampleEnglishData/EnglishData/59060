I recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specificbrain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them. Mind machineconsist of LED gogles, head phones, and a microprocessor that controls themThey strobe the (closed) eye and send sound pulses in sync with the flashinLEDs. I understand that these devices are experimental, but they are availableI've heard claims that they can induce sleep, and light trance states forelaxation. Essentially they are supposed to work without aid of drugs etc..I would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly usefulThe few sources I've seen are biased (they are selling the things, and friend who has tried them claims that "every home should have one"). Sodo these mind machines (aka Light and Sound machines) work? can they inducalpha, theta, and/or delta waves in a person wearing them? What research iany has been done on them? Could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizerOr are they just another bit of quackeryWeb Homehomer@tripos.co
