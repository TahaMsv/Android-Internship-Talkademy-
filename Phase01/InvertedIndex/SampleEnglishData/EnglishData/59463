After 2 years of having health problems that had beecleared up w/allery shots, and not knowing why, I went and was re-testedI actually did better than when I had been tested 2 years ago...Then putting 2 + 2 together, I realized that it all started back uwhen the laser printer came into the office.  I kept track of the usage, anon hi use days, I was worse.  I got better over the weekends...The laser printer is gone, I'm 100% better!!!..... Whether it is the tonedust or chemicals, I dont know (I am highly allergic to dust...), buit definitely was the laser printer...\t\t     brenda peter\t\t     carderock div, nswc, david taylor model basi\t\t     bethesda, md  2008\t\t     e-mail :   cape@dtvms.dt.navy.mi\t\t\t\t o\t\t\t\t bpeters@oasys.dt.navy.mi
