Tharcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the median eminence regionare particularly effected.  CVO areas are not subject to thblood-brain barrier. These areas control the release of gonadotropinwhich controls the release and flux of steroids governing developmentespecially sexual development. Changes in adult rats, which are lessensitive to Glu than humans, have been observed: after ingesting Gluon a chronic basis, cycles of several steroids are disrupted. Bloolevels of somatostatin are significantly reduced, and cyclic releasof steroids becomes flattened                    Hope this helps                    --Dianne Murray: wcsbeau@ccs.carleton.c
