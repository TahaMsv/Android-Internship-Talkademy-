Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into thlab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of i(as long as my advisor doesn't catch me - which is easy enough to do), butstamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant reviewcommittees and the peer review process in general.  In today's world that'swhat determines what science is: what gets funded.  And a damn good thing toFlights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything, atleast not in biomedical research.  The surest way for a graduate student truin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned withfleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a projecthat actually has a good chance of producing some results.  MD's seem tobe particularly prone to this aberrant behavior. >(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DN>electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.

I've read alot of thAlu and middle repetitive sequence work and it's really very interesting,good work with implications for many fields in molecular genetics.  It'sreally an example of how a well reasoned project turned up interestingresults that were unexpectedMik
