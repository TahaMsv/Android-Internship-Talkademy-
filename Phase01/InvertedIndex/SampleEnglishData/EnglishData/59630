I've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke, anthat it also makes the heart pumb slower, in order to make up for thgreater volume. My Internist, who diagnosed my AV block, slow heart ratand PVC's, told me something different. She says that heart rate iassociated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle, not itsize. Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume, but theffects are unrelated except for their common source. The AV block, shasserts, is another electrical effect, which is irreversable - even wheexercise is dicontinued. PVC's are also common in runners.So my EKG puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with hearpatients. Isn't that strange, though? Are there any not-so-beneficiaaspects to athlete's heart?
