It's amazing to see just how much was discovereby Canadians. Actually there are many more who were born in Canada, bubecame Americans after graduate schoolPlease note: a lot of people have nominated Alexander Graham Bell but feel he was really a Scottish/American with a summer home in Canada. NoI know this is debatable, but please don't nominate him againIf anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list, please drome a line=================================================That was two years ago. Since then, I have received a grant from SciencCulture Canada, a division of Supply and Services Canada to research thbook. Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational boofor kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) It will have abou40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphiboxes all around on the following subjects: Vital statistics and photo othe scientist, Personal statement from the scientist, Narrative of a femoments in the life of the scientist, "What I was doing when I was 12"So you want to be a <insert kind of scientist>, Experiment you can do. Therewill be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragrapbiographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thinwill then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for adderichness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part maalso be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed iCanada as wellI am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came closeto being it. Hope to find one soon.I would like to again ask for more nominations, especially in thpure sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Also criticisms ofthe list are welcomed. Also women and French-Canadian scientists are neededI hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great CanadiaScientists, and to discuss what is "great" what is "Canadian" and what i"scientist"Please respond toshell@sfu.coBarry Shell   604-876-5794692 Quebec St. Vancouver, B.C.
