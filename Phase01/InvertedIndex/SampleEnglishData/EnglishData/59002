This was passed by Congress in th1950's, before stuff like mass spectrometry became available, which increasedetectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitudeThis is why things like cyclamates and Red #2 were banned.  They are verweakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats, so under the Act they arbannedThis also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember time back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so goodand never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was bannedThis is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leavesIf it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days, someonwould do it, in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicatethat enforcement is still in effectAn odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as "gumbo file\'"This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves.  Thiis not only a natural product, but a natural product still in its naturaform, so maybe that's how they evade Delany.  Or maybe a special exemptiowas made, to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats
