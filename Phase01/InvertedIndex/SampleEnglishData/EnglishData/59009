Frequently of late, I have been reacting to something added trestaurant foods.  What happens is that the inside of my throat startto feel "puffy", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of mmouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffyThe situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurant(usually chinese), the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast foochain, a japanese steak house (I had the steak), and another chinesfast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two owhat looked like sugar or salt into my fried riceI am under the impression that MSG "enhances" flavor by causing thtaste buds to swell.  If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonablto assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swellAlso, as the many of the occurances (including two of the aboveinvolved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this iwhat I suspect as being the causeI wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animalshowed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a larat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funnyAnyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives artotally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studiethey know of.  I will probably respond to them however with a remindeof how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which thtobacco companies still deny)- D(If I sound grumpy, it's because I had beef with broccoli for lunctoday, and now it hurts to swallow------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dan Myers (Madman)\t\t| If the creator had intended us to walkmyers@usceast.cs.scarolina.edu\t| upright, he wouldn't have given us knuckle-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
