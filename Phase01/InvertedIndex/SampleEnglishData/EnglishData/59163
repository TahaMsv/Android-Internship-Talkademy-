Without knowing more it is nopossible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarringor temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine.  In general, there arno dietary limitations in patients with Crohn's except as they relatto obstruction.  There is no evidence that any foods will bring onrecurrence of Crohn's.  It is important to distinguish recurrence frorecurrent symptoms.  A physician would think of new inflammation asrecurrence, while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of thintestine. Your friend should look into membership in the Crohn's and ColitisFoundation of America.   1-800-932-242Good luck to your friendSteve Hollan
