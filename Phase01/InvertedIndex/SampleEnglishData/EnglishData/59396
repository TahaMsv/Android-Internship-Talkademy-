Surprise, surprise\tThis is true, but it's not quite the whole story.  There were\tactually some people who were more careful in their methodolog\twho also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.    One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotograph    is a Theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain th    hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura, electromagneti    or otherwise), professor of electrical engineering at London'    City University, and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research    named A. J. Ellison    After years of studying the method and the claims, Elliso    came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what w    calls 'Lichtenberg Figures,' an effect of intermittent ionization o    the air around the object.  It's a bit more complicated tha    'not wiping off the plates,' but it comes down to the same thin    in the end, Kirlian electrophotography has much more limite    value (if any) than was previously widely thought.  Electrical an    magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to b    of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment an    usually also tracer chemicals\t\t\t\t\tkind regards\t\t\t\t\ttod+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| Todd I.
