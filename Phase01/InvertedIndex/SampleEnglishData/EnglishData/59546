A friend was recently admitted to North Carolina Memorial Hospitabecause of suspected meningitis.  Serious business.  They wanted to da lumbar puncture, for which a CT scan is a prerequisiteI arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returnefrom the CT.   She was in tears.  Evidently the technicians in the Clab had been very unpleasant to herTo begin with, they put her on the apparatus that moves you into thmachine itself, and just pushed a button to slide her straight into thmachine, without any explanation.  Imagine this.  You worried you mahave a deadly disease, and next thing you know you're being put intthis big scary machine, without a word of explanation about what igoing to happen to you.  I believe this is inexcusable.   She waved hehand as if to say what are you doing to me, and they responded witannoyance and anger.  Next they inserted, or tried to insert, an Icatheter.  Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complaineof the pain.  The technician just stopped and fixed her with a glarwithout any words of explanationIs there anything I can do about these pigs I realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and daout.  And that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperativeBut this is simply no excuse.  Their purpose for existing is to helsick people, and there is no excuse for this sort of behaviorFortunately my friend is fine.  But I imagine a large proportion of thpeople who get CT scans are not fine at all.  They have cancer and thasort of thing.  They don't need this kind of shitAlso, since I named the hospital involved, I should also point out thaneither she nor I have any complaints about the competence or compassioof any of the other personnel at NCMHThanks for listeningJohn Eylejge@cs.unc.ed
