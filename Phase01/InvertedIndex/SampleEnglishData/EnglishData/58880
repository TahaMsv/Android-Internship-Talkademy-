I have bad luck and got a VD called <Granuloma ingunale>, which involvethe growth of granules in the groin.  I found out about it by checking medicinbooks and I found the prescriptions.  And I know I can just go to a clinic tget it cured.  BUT unfortunately I am serving my duty in the army right now anI think it's impossible to prevent anyone from knowing this if I take leavesevery day for two weeks for treatment.  Thus I bought the prescribed tabletat some drugstore, but to cure it I must get INJECTION of <Streptomycin>, wita dose of 1g every 12 hours, for at least 10 days.  I can probably buy thetools and this solution somewhere but I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO INJECTION BY MYSELCan any kind people here tell meIf it's possible to do it? Can I do it on my arm? or it must be done on the hionly??  Any info is welcome and please write me or post your help SOON!! (I aalready taking the tablets ..and I can't wait!!Please don't flame me for posting this, and don't judge me. I've learned alesson and all I need now is REAL MEDICAL HELPDesperate from Taipei
