Hi, We are trying to develop a image reconstruction simulation for the skull.  The problem we are having is that we cannot obtain 3D data for the skull.  We can just video a rotating skull, but that will only give us 2 dimensionsAnyone out there got any suggestionsPlease helThanGarUniversity of the WitwatersranJohannesbur
