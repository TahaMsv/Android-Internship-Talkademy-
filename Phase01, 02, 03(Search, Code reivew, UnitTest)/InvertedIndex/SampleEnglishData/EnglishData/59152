The quacks don't do cultures: They poo-poo doing more lab tests:  "this is Lyme, believe me, I\'v: seen it many times.  The lab tests aren't accurate.  We'll treat i: now."  Also, is Dr. N\'s practice almost exclusively devoted to treatin: Lyme patients?  I don't know *any* orthopedic surgeons who fit thi: pattern.  They are usually GPsNo, he does not exclusively treat LD patients.  However, in some parts of thcountry, you don\'t need to be known as an LD "specialist" to see a largnumber of LD patients walk through your office.  Given the huge problem ounderdiagnosis, orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease jusabout every day in their regular practices.  Dr. N. told me that last yearhe sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is nothe only orthopedists in the townLet's say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at th*very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stagmanifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed bneurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problewe have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LpatientHe refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts thpatient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, tthe knees)Gordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs-Marc-----------------------------------------------------------------------              Marc C.
