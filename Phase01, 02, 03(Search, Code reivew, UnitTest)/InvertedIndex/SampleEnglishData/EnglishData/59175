I had allergy shots for about four years starting as a sophomore in higschool.  Before that, I used to get bloody noses, nighttime asthma attacksand eyes so itchy I couldn't get to sleep.  After about 6 months on thshots, most of those symptoms were gone, and they haven't come back.  stopped getting the shots (due more to laziness than planning) in collegeMy allergies got a little worse after that, but are still nowhere near abad as they used to be.  So yes, the shots do work
