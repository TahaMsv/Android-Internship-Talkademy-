She said even common ear infections frequently seen ichildren are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment"Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseasewould soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseaseremain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illnesand death in the United States," the CDC saidIt  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a "myriad" of newlidentified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, deadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus thacauses AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome"The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under controlsuch as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas,the CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have beeundermined by drug resistance=====*====SOURCE:  WALL STREET JOURNAREFERENCE: 04/15/93, pBHEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability IssueThe tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to causdamage: legal liabilityA federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for nodoing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as mucattention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-likillness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and irare instances death. The decision last week has put property owneron notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves frothe ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation isomeone becomes infected while on the propertyThe decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York camafter a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for thLong Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted thdisease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He orderethe New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more tha$560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medicaexpenses and lost wagesSummer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural osemirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among thgroups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen LKass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potentialiability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyarbarbecue might be potentially liableLawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. A summevacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the homshe rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her RockMountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury orderean outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who wastung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanenquadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidencthat a beehive was near the restaurantBut lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout thcountry -- it's most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantistates, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make thiparticular insect bite a particularly litigious oneThe illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in thcourtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers wilcover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for nodiagnosing the diseaseLawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme diseashave become common in some states in recent years. Payments iworker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs anlost earningsThe case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much morlucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question onegligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governininjuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as result, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Propertowners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in manother situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry thdiseaseIra M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn Maurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will helto establish "the duty of all sorts of property owners to protecagainst Lyme disease.Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision, winning lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. Foone thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down wheand where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffin the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owneby the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bittenThe workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere tthe insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surroundesome work sitesA spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof thathe four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad iconsidering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's findinthat it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman saythe railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and speciapants to protect against bug bitesDebate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open usome legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether victim actually has the disease rather than some other illnessEarlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Associatioreported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme diseaseAnd damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medicadisputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causesBecause of health and safety concerns, some groups and companiealready take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Lasyear, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson Co. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Bostothat is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medicalsupply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the companwas worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation mighget infectedRuth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association iIndianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by heorganization also have begun to check children for ticks. And CarolKatz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property OwnerAssociation, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat thei100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killinpesticide=====*====TITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme diseaseAUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IHDepartment of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas JeffersoUniversity, Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaREFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-3Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, iassociated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patientwith neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunctionUrodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients andetrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was nonoted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tracmay be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voidindysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete madirectly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by thLyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urologicasymptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence waprotracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurologicadeficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lymdisease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differentiadiagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladdemanagement including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamievaluation is recommendedIV. ***** QUESTIONS 'N' ANSWERS ****Note: If you have a response to this question, please forward it to theditorSender: Terry Morse <morset@ccmail.orst.eduSubject: Question on Lyme Vectors and Compost Pile  When I visited my sister on Long Island, NY, I was cautioned to avoid thcompost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she becaminfected  A friend of mine here in Oregon who has a compost heap would like me tback that claim up with documentation.
