>So I'll ask this,  my neurologist just prescribed Cafergot an>Midrin as some alternatives for me to try.  He stated tha>the sublingual tablets of ergotamine were no longer available>Any idea why?  He also suggested trying 800 mg ibuprophenI just found out about the sublinguals disappearing too.  I don'know why.  Perhaps because they weren't as profitable as cafergotToo bad, since tablets are sometimes vomited up by migraine patientand they don't do any good flushed down the toilet.  I suspecwe'll be moving those patients more and more to the DHE nasaspray, which is far more effective-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, angeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."---------------------------------------------------------------------------
