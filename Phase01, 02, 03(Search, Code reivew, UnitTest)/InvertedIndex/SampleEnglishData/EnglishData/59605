This is NOT a nice way to dieNice explanation except that it isn't N-hydroxylation that causes thformation of the N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), but rather direct two-electron oxidation. In addition, there is one school of thoughthat contends that oxidative stress rather than arylation of proteiis the more critical factor in the hapatotoxcity of acetaminophen. As far as drug toxicities go, acetaminophen has and continues to be onof the most intensely scrutinized. An excellent recent review of the topican be found in:\tVermeulen, Bessems and Van de Straat. \\tMolecular Aspects of Paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity and it\tMechanism-Based Prevention.

I've heard a number of descriptions bphysicians associated with poison control centers, and they describe lingering very painful death.-Gary
