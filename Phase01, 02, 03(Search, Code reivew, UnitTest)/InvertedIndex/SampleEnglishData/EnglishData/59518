So anything that I say is not due to brainwashingby this "hated" book.  It\'s okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate meElisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th EditionA book that you should be familiar with and not "hate". "Candida speciescolonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortlythereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present. Indeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemicmycosis."  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemicinfection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or"sick" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistentparasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasisYour assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not disputeitWhat I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemicinfection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritatio(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterialcompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candidablooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser\'s again: "However, some factors, such asthe use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose toboth mucosal and systemic infections".  I was addressing mucosal infection(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach coversthis effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the "cure".  I guess thatyour nutrition course does not, too bad. >>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly>>called, are not truely caused by yeasts.

If younoticed my faculty rank, I'm a biochemist, not a microbiologistCandida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But, as you pointout, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells,pseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologistand that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it's a lot ofGreek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify meYou know Elisabeth, I still haven't been able to figure out why such a smalllittle organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people inSci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging tooI keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about whatI've said, that it will make sense.  I'm not asking anyone here to buy into"The Yeast Connection" book because I don\'t know what\'s in that book, plainand simple. And to be honest with you, I'm beginning to wish that it was neverwrittenMarty B
