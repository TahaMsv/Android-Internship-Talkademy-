I'certainly not questioning Steve's claims, as for one I am not a doctor, and agree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's.  But inflammatiocan be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to foodHaving had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enougcaveat :-), I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.  Basicallythe idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not brealized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the foldof inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problemTherefore, anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of commoinflammation should be avoided.  With what I've been told is typical Crohn'sof the terminal ileum, my diet should be low residue, consisting ofCompletely out - never again - items\to corn (kernel husk doesn't digest ... most of us know this :-\to popcorn (same\to dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skin\to nuts (Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-Discouraged greatly\to raw vegetables (too fibrous\to wheat and raw grain bread\to exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water\to greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...\to little seeds, like sesame (try getting an Arby's without it!\to long grain and wild rice (husky\to beans (you'll generate enough gas alone without them!\to BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processinI was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in thiday and age).  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give yousystem as little chance to inflame as possible.  I was told that among thNUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged (I only listed a few), to trthe ones I wanted and see how I felt.  If it's bad, don't do it againRemember though that this was while I was in remission.  For Veggies: cook thdaylights out of them.  I prefer steaming ... I think it's cooks morthoroughly - you're mileage may varyAs with anything else, CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR.  Don't just take my word.  Buthis is the info I've been given, and it may be a starting point fodiscussion.  Good luck-Spense--S.
