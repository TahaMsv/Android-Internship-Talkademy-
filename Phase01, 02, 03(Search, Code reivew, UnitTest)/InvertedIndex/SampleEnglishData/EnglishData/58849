In normal condition, the concentration of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid is about2 uM that is high enough to activate one type of glutamate receptor-the NMDreceptor. But the question is Neuron and glial cell in the brain have a lots of transport to get glutamate into Neuron or glial. So no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons.Glutamate is most important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It is involved in not only in daily life like the controling of movement, it is alsoinvolved in develpoment, memory and learn (it is involved in Logn-term potentialtion that be thought is the basis of learning).
