(Theseare not, by the way, "extra" heartbeats.  This is how they feel, andthis is how I described them initially to the doctor, but they'reactually *premature* heartbeats.  I would sometimes experience a lapseafter one of these that went on for a suffocatingly long period of time,making me wonder if my heart were ever going to beat again.)I had them persistently for eighteen years.  Then I went on a low-fatdiet, and they just stopped.  I haven't had a single episode of PVHfor almost two years.  I know:  correlation does not imply causation.This is just FWIW. --Barbara
