  Ron Roth recommends: "Once you have your hypoglycemia CONFIRMED through the                        proper channels, you might consider ther following:...                        [diet omitted1) Ron...what do YOU consider to be "proper channels"...this sounds suspiciousllike a blood chemistry...glucose tolerance and the like...suddenly chemistryexists? You know perfectly well that this person can be saved needless troubleand expense with simple muscle testing and hair analysis to diagnose...n"CONFIRM" any aberrant physiology...but then again...maybe that\'s what you meantby "proper channels.2) Were you able to understand Dick King\'s post that "90% of diseases is not thesame thing as 90% of patients" which was a reply to your inability to criticallevaluate the statistic you cited from the New England Journal of Medicine. Couldyou figure out what is implied by the remark "Of course MDs are ethically bound to not knowingly dispense placebos..."3) Ron...have you ever thought about why you never post in misc.health.alternative...and insist instead upon insinuating your untrained, non-medical, oftendelusional notions of health and disease into this forum? I suspect from youapparent anger toward MDs and heteropathic medicine that there may be aunderlying 'father problem'...of course I can CONFIRM this by surrogate muscltesting one of my patients while they ponder my theory to see if one of their previously weak 'indicator' muscles strengthens...or do you have reservationabout my unique methods of diagnosis? Oh..I forgot what you said in an earliepost.."neither am I concerned of whether or not my study designs meet your oanyone else\'s criteria of acceptance."John Badanes, DC, Cromdas@uclink.berkeley.edideas
