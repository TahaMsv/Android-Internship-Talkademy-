But colonic flushes are not theway to improve gut function.  Each person has almost a unique mix ofbacteria in his/her gut.  Diet affects this mix as does the use ofantibiotics.  A diet change is a much better way to alter the players inyour gut than is colonic flushes.  Cross contamination has been a realproblem in some of the outfits that do this "treatment" since the equipmentis not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient "treatments"Dental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and I'vepicked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of hisinstruments(more clostly but much safer).  Full sterile technique isalso used just like that practiced in an OR(mask, gloves and gowns worn anddisposed of between patients).  Each visit costs me 15 dollars more thanthe standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket.  His muchhigher fees do not drive away patientsI can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves tothis colonic flush procedure.  For very little, if any benefit, yousubject yourself to hepatitis, cholera, parasitic disease and even HIVJust ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatmentCould they be having GI distress?  Could this distress be due to apathogenic organism?  Could I get this organism if the equipment is notcleaned properly between patients?  Do I really want to take this riskFood for thoughtMarty B
