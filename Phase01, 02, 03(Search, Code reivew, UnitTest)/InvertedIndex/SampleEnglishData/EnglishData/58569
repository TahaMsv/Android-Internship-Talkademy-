The better ones also includadvice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware twarn of a break, others use beeps or screen messagesOften, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain haa delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typinall day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the eveningThese tools act as an early warning system: by listening to theiwarnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for yourbody to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI    Tool: At Your Service (commercial software    Available from\tBright Sta\tTel: +1 (206) 451 369    Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Window    Description\tProvides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info.\tWarns when to take a break (configurable).

Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of wor\tyou do - data entry, word processing, information processing\tExercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text o\thow to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does\tCHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use\tto learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other informatio\ton non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer\tA full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included\tCHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not the\twarn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appea\tuseful when used with Windows\tCost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses    Comments\tThe keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems bette\tto measure the activity that is causing you problems than t\tmeasure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuf\tis very good and includes some summaries of research papers\tas well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company\tto pay up for RSI management tools.

Free demo ($5 outside US)    Comments\tI have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would sa\tit is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because i\tdoes not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, i\tinterrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, whic\tis not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK o\tWindows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sur\twhy. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and ha\tone window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does no\trequire any sound hardware    Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software    Available from\tVisionary Softwar\tP.O.

Its user interfac\tdesign is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual\texpensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the onl\ttool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post i\ton your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers\tDoes not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does\thave the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence\twhich is good for repeating the most helpful exercises    Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992    Available from\tEmail to richardd@hoskyns.co.u\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.sha    Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode    Description\tThis is a shell script that runs in the background and warns yo\tto stop typing, based on how long you have been continuousl\ttyping.  It does not provide exercises, but it does chec\tthat you really do take a break, and tells you when yo\tcan start typing again. \tTypewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typin\ttoday, each time it warns you, which is useful so yo\tknow how much you *really* type.  It also logs informatio\tto a file that you can analyse or simply print out. \tThe warning message appears on your screen (in character mode)\tin a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr messag\t(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu>\thas put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for\tX, Zephyr and Mach\tNot formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.u\t(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach\tX Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give\tfeedback    Tool: Various calendar / batch queue program    Available from\tVarious source    Platforms: Variou    Description\tAny calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcomin\tappointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool\tOr, any batch queue submission program that lets you submi\ta program to run at a specific time to display a message t\tthe screen\tUsing Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, an\tinclude this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line s\tyou get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose yo\twant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am\tPress F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, ente\t9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the brea\tis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat\tfor the next appointment\tBy using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystroke\tthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put thi\tfile on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, wit\ta single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointment\twith RSI exercises\tThe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs.\tAn example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple jo\tthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this wil\tdepend a lot on your operating system\tWhile these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing\tyourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI\tmanagement tool.  If you are techie enough you might want t\twrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operatin\tsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timer    Available from\tVarious sources, e.g. Casio BP-100    Description\tMany digital watches have timers that count down from a settabl\tnumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, eithe\tmanually or automatically. \tWhile these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if yo\tare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away fro\ta computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The grea\tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever yo\tare doing\    Comments\tMy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led t\tmy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, whic\tactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the lef\tarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has bee\tvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day\tI have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, bu\tthese are not much good because they do not give an audibl\twarning of the end of the time periodKEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mappinso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout. One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about howyou use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload yoare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typingand may therefore make matters worse    Tool: hsh (public domain    Available from\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.sha    Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones    Description\tAllows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings\tOnly works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal o\tan xterm, but not most X programs)    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various    Available from\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.\tAlso built into Windows 3.x.    Description\tThe Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layou\tthat involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help preven\tRSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since\tit will slow down your typing a *lot* :-) --Dan Wallach               "One of the most attractive features of a Connectiodwallach@cs.berkeley.edu  Machine is the array of blinking lights on the faceOffice#: 510-642-9585     of its cabinet." -- CM Paris Ref.
