If you have food that you want toenhance with msg just put the MSG on the table like salt.  It ithen the option of the eater to use it.  If you make a commericaproduct, just leave it out. You can include a packet (like somsalt packets) if you desireSalt, pepper, mustard, ketchup, pickles ..... are table optionsTreat MSG the same way.  I wouldn't shove my condiments down youthroat, don't shove yours down mineWF--Walter Lundb
