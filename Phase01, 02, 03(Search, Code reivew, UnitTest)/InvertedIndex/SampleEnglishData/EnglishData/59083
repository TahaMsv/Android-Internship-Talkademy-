I experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning.  Just afteI completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight traininday and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end othe 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold, turned paleand lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasn't thaheavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a fewminutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued witchest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  BuI dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continuearm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do musual hour on the ski machine either.  I'll take it easy for the rest othe dayMy arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal -my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normaand it is no longer cold.Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course througmy brain.  I'm 34, vegetarian, and pretty fit from my daily exercisregimen.  So that can't be it.  Could a pinched nerve from the bacause these symptoms (I hope)Has this happened to anyone elseNothing like this has ever happened to me before.
