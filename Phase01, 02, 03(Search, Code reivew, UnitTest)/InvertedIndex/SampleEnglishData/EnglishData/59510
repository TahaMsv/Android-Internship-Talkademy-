My OB and I decided to go for a csec.  The OB called ithe anesthisiologist (sp?) and asked him to help prep me for surgeryAFTER, watching me go through a couple contractions, the anes (or anus aI like to refer to him) said, "Well, I am off duty now." (still starinbetween my legs at that).  The OB asked to go call whomever it was whwas on duty and ask him/her how long it would take...and if it was gointo take more than a few minutes, to please stay even though he was off dutyThe anes. went out, supposedly to call the on-call anes.   In a couple ominutes the nurse came running in to tell the OB that the anes. had lefwithout even trying to get ahold of the on-call.  It was the only timeduring my labor that I swore.
