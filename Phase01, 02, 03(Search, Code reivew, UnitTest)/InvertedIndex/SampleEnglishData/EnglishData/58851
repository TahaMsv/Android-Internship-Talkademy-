He said it may cause GI problems and I have a sensitive stomach   to begin with.  Anybody ever taken this antibiotic.  Any good?  Suggestions   for avoiding an upset stomach?  Other tipsI've taken Septra.  My daughter has taken it many times for eainfections.  It works sometimes.  It is a sulfa drug.  About the onlproblem I found was that I'm sensitive and developed a rash after nindays of a ten day course.  No more Septra for me.  My doctor waremiss in not telling me to watch out for a rash.  I was quite in thdark and didn't realize that it could be a drug reaction.  No hardone thoughDou-Douglas S.
