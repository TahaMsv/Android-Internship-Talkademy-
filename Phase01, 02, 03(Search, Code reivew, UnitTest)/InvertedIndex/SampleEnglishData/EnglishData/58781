I am a picky eater and never wanted totry chinese food, however, I finally tried some in order to please girl I was seeing at the time.  I had never heard of Chinese restauransyndrome.  A group of us went to the restaurant and all shared 6 differendishes.  It didn't taste great, but I decided it wasn't so bad.  We wenhome and went to bed early.  I woke up at 2 AM and puked my guts outsI threw up for so long that (I'm not kidding) I pulled a muscle imy tongue.  Dry heaves and everything.  No one else got sick, and I'not allergic to anything that I know of. Suffice to say that I wont go into a chinese restaurant unless I amphysically threatened.  The smell of the food makes me ill (and that *isa psycholgical reaction).  When I have been dragged in to suffethrough beef and broccoli without any sauces, I insist on no MSG. I haven't gotten sick yet--Doug Bank                       Private Systems Divisiodougb@ecs.comm.mot.com          Motorola Communications Sectodougb@nwu.edu                   Schaumburg, Illinoidougb@casbah.acns.nwu.edu       708-576-8207
