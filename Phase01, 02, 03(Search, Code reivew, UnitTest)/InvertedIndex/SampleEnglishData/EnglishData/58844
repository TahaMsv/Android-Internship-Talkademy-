It would appear thasomething quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observatiointo that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation).

Nor am I prepared to give a general account orationality.  In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibblover what a "surprising" experiment is, what counts as "surprising", etcThe same may be said about "logical grounds".  My point is that quite frequentl(perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced tpreviously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses osome other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examplesuch as Toricelli\'s Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his "sea of airhypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) "surprising"Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly musbe counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designedout of "perfectly rational grounds"?  Well, there was a pretty successful anwell know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicitThe novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a noveltat the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it "new"?  Well, oncould argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a nedomain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if yolike--Gary H.
