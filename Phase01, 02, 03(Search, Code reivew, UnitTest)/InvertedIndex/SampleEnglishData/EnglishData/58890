This has beean ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirementfor many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular diseaseUp to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to "prove" thathe disease existsThis paper is noteworthy in two other regards1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The doghad episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-months after exposure.  After this period, none showed any furtheclinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  Sthese are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneourecovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observationlonger than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn'have the same chronicity that some see in humans2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by thvaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they wanthe world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccinefficacyAnyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluationof this vaccine in the next year or so-Jeff Parke <jeffp@pgavin1.vetmed.wsu.edualso:   jeffp@WSUVM1.bitnet    AOL: JeffParkWashington State University College of Veterinary Medicine class of 199Pullman, WA  99164-701
