This disease isuniversally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, thetumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forummember checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki's track record for this disease. He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years fromglioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who hadaudited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive. After the forum member's father began Dr. Burzynski's treatment inSeptember, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of hisoncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs ofshrinkage or necrosisThe patient's oncologist, although telling him he would probably not livepast December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski'streatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski'streatment, she's since changed her attitude toward continuing thesetreatments, saying "if it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it.Dr. Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found aprotein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it,and administers it to patients with certain cancer types.
