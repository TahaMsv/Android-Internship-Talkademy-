I probably could have lived with the insomnia if thProzac had done any good, but it only provided a tiny benefit.  Maybbecause the person who prescribed it didn't know much and gave up after 20mg dose didn't workNow I'm seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on Zoloft (another serotonireuptake inhibitor like Prozac).  One pill/day (50mg) seemed to help some.Now I'm trying 100mg/day.  Zoloft has fewer and milder side effects thaProzac.  I think my doctor said that only 4% of the people taking Zolofhave to discontinue it because of side effects.  The only problem I'having is some minor GI distress, but nothing too annoying.  Hopefully thZoloft will work.  Maybe your friend should try this one nextMy psychiatrist's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonidrugs, usually Prozac.  If that works, great.  If it works but has too manside effects, try Zoloft or maybe Paxil.  If the serotonin drugs don't worat all, try one of the tricyclics like desipramine>...suggestions as to the next stepHaving a doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make a bidifference.  My psychiatrist claims that most GPs and FPs don't have mucexperience in this area, and from what I've seen I'm inclined to believhim.  I think I know more about antidepressants than the people at mfamily practitioner's officeDisclaimer: I'm not a doctor; what I know about this comes from talking tmy psychiatrist and reading sci.med. -John Werner                          werner@soe.berkeley.edUC Berkeley School of Education      510-596-586
