Letting one's mind roafreely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of cominup with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysiof the problem first. Scientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is somethinthat one learns.  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learnedbut training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of thekey elements in developing it. Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding nescientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalististudies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for thetheory of evolution. This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizeempirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informaexploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculatiodoes not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empiricastudies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a verpoor kind of science.
