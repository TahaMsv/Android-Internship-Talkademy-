>has any one heard of a sedative called "Rhoepnol"? Made by LaRouche>I believe. Any info as to side effects or equivalent tranquillizersYou probably mean "RoHypnol", a member of the benzodiazepine familychemical name is flunitrazepam. It is such a strong tranquilizer that it iprobably best refered to as a hypnotic, rather than a tranquilizer. Just onpill will knock you on your ass. Side effects may be similar to valium, xanaxserax, librium and other benzodiazepines.--============================================================================Neal Howard   '91 XLH-1200      DoD #686      CompuTrac, Inc (Richardson, TX\t      doh #0000001200   |355o33|      neal@cmptrc.lonestar.or\t      Std disclaimer: My opinions are mine, not CompuTrac's         "Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhap          we shall learn the truth." -- August Kekule\' (1890============================================================================
