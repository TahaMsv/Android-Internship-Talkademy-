A bit more than a year ago, a hernia in my right groin wadiscovered.  It had produced a dull pain in that area.  The herniwas repaired using the least intrusive (orthoscopic?) method and "plug and patch"The doctor considered the procedure a successA few months later the same pain returned.  The doctor said thahe could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repairNow the pain occurs more often.  My GP couldn't identify anspecific problem.  The surgen who performed the original procedurnow says that yes there is a "new" hernia in the same area and hsaid that he has to cut into the area for the repair this timeMy question to the net:  Is there a nonintrusive method tdetermine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is frosomething elseSteve Heffne
