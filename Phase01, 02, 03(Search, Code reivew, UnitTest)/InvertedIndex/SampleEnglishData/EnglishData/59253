Putting aside our substantial differences, I'd like to ask the knowledgeablones to give feedback on this.  Let me explainOne of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor aftehaving some difficulties with walking and writing (she is 64 years old)Otherwise, she is in fine health.  The discovery was made via CAT scansShe then had MRI scans done, where small cancerous areas were discoverein her lungs.  Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma.  One spot iin the lungs, and another in the pneumothorax.  The oncologists believthe cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smokeuntil four years ago)Anyway, I'd like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is, how it is differenfrom other cancers, how she will be treated (luckily the tumor is righbelow the skull and can be easily removed), and statistically what arthe chances for full remission/recoveryThanksJon Norin--Charter Member --->>>  INFJ ClubIf you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info============================================================================| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          | JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE | 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    | Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          ============================================================================Who are you?
