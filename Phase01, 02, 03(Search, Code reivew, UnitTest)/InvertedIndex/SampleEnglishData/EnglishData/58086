Sumatriptan(Imitrex) just became available in the US in a subcutaneouinjectable form.  Is there an oral form available in CA?  A friend(yereally not me!)  has severe migranes about 2-3 times per week.  Wlive right by the CA border and he has gotten drugs for GERD prescribeby a US physician and filled in a CA pharmacy, but not yet FDA approvein the US.  What would be the cost of the oral form in CA$ also ianyone would have that info?   Thank
