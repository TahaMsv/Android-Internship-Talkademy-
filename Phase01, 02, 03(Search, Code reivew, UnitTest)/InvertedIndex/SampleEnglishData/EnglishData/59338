Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized "jargon"necessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fullcognizant of since I, too, speak "jargonese" when with my peers).  For thsituation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors cahave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in thworld at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example wordand very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of "systemic"It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, mucmore so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation othis newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentiallequal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fathe flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors gereally "beat up" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which theotherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasiona"difficult" patientPoint 2I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will noprescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatmenthave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructeclinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies arpart of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do andifferently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And ifollows that any therapy not on the "accepted" list is therefore a nontherapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis otheory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolatioof what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, froa treatment point-of-viewAnd by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practicescience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, aalso being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those peoplthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, wher"standard" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back anwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid "scientific" viewpoint is iitself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlyinintent of the "scientific" approach to medicine is to protect the health othe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so thpatient should come first when considering treatmentWhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies botthe "scientific" and the "humanitarian" viewpoints.  In an earlier post outlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give anphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribalternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidencefor patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhauste(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that suctherapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and thathere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derivefrom themThis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfiethe humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patientwho have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using acceptemedicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to thdoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losintheir license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medicatraining.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the contromore within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleanecould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the mosproductive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presentemore as a strawman to stimulate discussionHopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as twhy I am "open" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have readifficulty (read "apparent hostility") with the "coldness" of the 99.9% pur"scientific" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medicatreatment is one where both the "humanitarian" aspects are balanced with anby the "scientific" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imhoJust my 'NF' leanings, I guess.  :^CommentsJon Norin--Charter Member --->>>  INFJ ClubIf you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info============================================================================| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          | JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE | 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    | Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          ============================================================================Who are you?
