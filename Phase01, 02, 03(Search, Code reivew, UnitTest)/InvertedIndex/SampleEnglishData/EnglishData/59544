HiMy wife has aquired some thyroidal (sp?) deficiency over the past yeathat gives symptoms such as needing much sleep, coldness and pronenesto gaining weight. She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary (?tests and her values were regarded as low. The doctor (and my wife) arnot very interested in starting medication as this "deactivates" thegland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). The last couple ofmonthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been givesome drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate languagebut I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but thebrain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.)My questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approachHer values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on thprobability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to 'eanormally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feelthat is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may thiaffect the treatment, developmentI can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested, and will greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topicI don't intend this post to be either a flaming of the establishemedical profession or a praise for alternatives, I am just relayinevents as they have happenedSincerelyErik A.
