I guess there aren't man: medical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactionsI saw the same thing happen to my father, and I can more or less validate youtake on hospitals.  It seems to me that medical science understands precioulittle about taking care of the human machine.  Drugs are given as response to symptoms (and I guess that makes sense since all the studies thatvalidate the effectiveness of those drugs are based on a narroassessment of the degree of particular symptoms).  But there seemto be very little appreciation for the well-being of a persooutside of the numbers that appear on a test.  I watched my dawither away and lose huge amounts of body fat and muscles tissuwhile in the hospital.  There is something a little crazy about system in which there is more attention paid to giving you everlatest drug available than there is attention paid to whether yohave had enough to eat to prevent loss of muscle tissue.  It ireally, really bizarre.   --Will Estes\t\tInternet: westes@netcom.co
