Same circumstance, same onset symptoms,same cafergot uselessness, same duration.  In fact, of all the peoplI know who have migraines, none have been so similar.  There is suca wide variation between people with respect to what causes theiheadaches, that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learneabout mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observationsI don't think it's heat, per se (I've had more in winter than summer)Dehydration could conceivably figure, though.  Try tanking up beforplaying rather than afterBeing in shape doesn't seem to help me much, eitherI've identified four factors that do make a difference (listed indescending order of importance)1) Heavy exercis2) Sleep deprivatio3) Fasting\t\t(e.g., skipped breakfast4) Physical trauma\t(e.g., head bonkHeavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines, but Idon't get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more ofthe other factors *must* be present (usually #2).  Since I discoveredthis, I've been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every twoor three years when I get cocky ("It\'s been so long, maybe I just don\'tget them anymore") and stop being carefulHope this is helpfulJohn
