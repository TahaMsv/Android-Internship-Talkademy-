I don't know if anyone knows about this topic: electrical heartfailure. One of my friends has had to go to the doctor becaushe had chest pains. The Doc said it was Arythmia. So he had tgo to a new york hospital for a lot of money to get treated. Hidoctors said that he could die from it, and the medication causecancer ( that he was taking). Well, I suggested that he run, excersizand eat more, ( he is very skinny) but he says that has nothinto do with it. Does anyone know what causes arythmia and howit can be treated\t\t\tThanks
