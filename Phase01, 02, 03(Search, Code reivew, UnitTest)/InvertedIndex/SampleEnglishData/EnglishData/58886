Some recent postings remind me that I had read about risksassociated with the barbecuing of foods, namely that carcinogensare generated. Is this a valid concern? If so, is it a functionof the smoke or the elevated temperatures? Is it a function ofthe cooking elements, wood or charcoal vs. lava rocks? I wishto know more. Thanks.
