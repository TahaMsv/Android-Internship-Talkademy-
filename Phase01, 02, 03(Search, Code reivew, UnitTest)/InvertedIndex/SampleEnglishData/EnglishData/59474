I had stoneseveral years ago, and there's now way I could have made it withouheavy duty doses of morphine and demerol and a two week stay in thhospital. I was told that there was nothing that I could take that wouldissolve them. If the stones are passible, the best thing she could dis drink LOTS of water, and hope that they pass, but every time themove a little, the pain will be excrutiating. I was told by my doctoat that time that the pain was comparable to that of childbirth. (Yesby a male doctor, so I'm sure some of you women will disagree). I'really like to know the truth in this, so maybe some of you women whhave had a baby and a kidney stone could fill me in.-Jeff Silv(707) 577-268jeffs@sr.hp.co
