Any rocky mountain spotted fever experts out there The doctor thinks a friend might have thisThe question is, doesn't the tick have to bite you You frequently find a tick crawling on you after a walin the woods around here, but you tend to notice it beforit bites you; pulling one out of your skin is somethinyou're not likely to forgetCan you get the fever without it biting you ?  Do thesometimes bite you and then let go so you don't realizyou were bitten ?  I know they will let go once they've hatheir fill, but you certainly would notice this (arggh)So how do you get the fever if you never pulled a ticoff yourself (as opposed to finding one merely crawlinon you) John Eylejge@cs.unc.ed
