 To: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David NyeThere is a person on the FIDO CFS echo who claims that he wascured of CFS by taking accutane.  He also claims that you areusing it in the treatment of Fibromyalgia Syndrome.  Are youusing accutane in the treatment of Fibromyalgia Syndrome?  Haveyou used it for CFS?  Have you gotten good results with it?  Areyou aware of any double blind studies on the use of accutane inthese conditions?  Thank you in advance for all replies... I think they should rename Waco TX to Wacko TX
