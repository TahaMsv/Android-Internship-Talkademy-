Spoofing a keyboard over the serial por\tIf you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboar\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time findin\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstatio\truns the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap use\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cabl\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to rea\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events\tThe two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, an\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a serve\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if you\tserver can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these string\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later\tor bugging your vendor\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu    2.

Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through th\ttrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals ad\textra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard aroun\tfor the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key    3. NeX\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Deskto\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced the\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind o\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now    4. Silicon Graphic\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 an\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don'\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's no\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except b\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for mor\tdetails    5. IBM RS/600\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  |\tUnfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  |\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   |\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe |\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it |\tworks.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  |\ttold Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn |\tanything new, please send me e-mail.\t\t\t\t    |       6.
