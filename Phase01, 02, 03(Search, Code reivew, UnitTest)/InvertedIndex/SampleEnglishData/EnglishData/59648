:Chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a live:biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases month:after a bout of acute viral hepatitis, or when someone is found to hav:persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests. The degree o:elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten time:normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal.:As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease.:Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, a:least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means o:a biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient wit:CAH needs to be treatedI just went back to the chapter in Cecil on chronic hepatitis.  It seemthat indeed most cases of CPH are persistant viral hepatitis, whereathere are a multitude of potential and probable causes for CAH (viraldrugs, alcohol, autoimmune, etc.).  Physicians seem to have a variety o"thresholds" for electing to biopsy someone\'s liver.  Personally, I thinthat if the patient is asymptomatic, with only slight transaminitis annormal albumin and PT, one can simply follow them closely and not add thpotential risks of a biopsy.  Others may well biopsy such a patient, thuproviding these samples for study.  It would be interesting to see ianyone's done any decision analysis on this--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   =  General Internal Medicine      |      "...dammit, not a programmer!" =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
