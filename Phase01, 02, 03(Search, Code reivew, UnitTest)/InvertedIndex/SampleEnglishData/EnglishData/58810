=Surprise surprise, different people react differently to different things. On=slightly off the subject case in point. My brother got stung by a bee. I kno=he is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localize=swelling, not anaphylactic shock. I could not convince the doctors of that=however, because that's not written in their little rule bookOf course, bee venom isn't a single chemical.  Could be your brother ireacting to a different component than the one that causes anaphylactic shocin other peopleSimilarly, Chinese food isn't just MSG.  There are a lot of other ingredientin it.  Why, when someone eats something with lots of ingredients they don'normally consume, one of which happens to be MSG, do they immediately concludthat any negative reaction is to the MSG=I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have ba=reactions to MSG, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomitingI'd be surprised if some of these reactions weren't due to other ingredients-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Carl J Lydick | INTERnet: CARL@SOL1.GPS.CALTECH.EDU | NSI/HEPnet: SOL1::CARDisclaimer:  Hey, I understand VAXen and VMS.  That's what I get paid for.  Munderstanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level (or below).  Sunless what I'm saying is directly related to VAX/VMS, don't hold me or morganization responsible for it.  If it IS related to VAX/VMS, you can try thold me responsible for it, but my organization had nothing to do with it
