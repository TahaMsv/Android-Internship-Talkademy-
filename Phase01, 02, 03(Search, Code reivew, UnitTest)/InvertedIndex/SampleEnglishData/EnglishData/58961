     Following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion omy white cells. (The theory as I understand it is that there is some kinof immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy ait normally would a "foreign" body. Where this blocking is deficient, thbody evicts the "intruder", resulting in a miscarriage. The white cellapparently enhance the blocking capability.) Following the transfusion, shsuccessfully carried the next pregnancy to term, and Jake is now an activ9 month-old who cannot wait to walk     We're now thinking about having another child, but no one (includinthe OBGYN who supervised the first transfusion) really seems to knowhether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successivpregnancies     Is there anyone in net-land who has experience with thisThanks...Gene (and Jane and JakeP.S.
