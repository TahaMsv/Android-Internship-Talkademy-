From THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY GUIDE TO TOTAL NUTRITION: Stanley Gershoff,   Ph.D., Dean of Tufts University School of Nutrition; HarperPerennial, 199   (ISBN #0-06-272007-4)\t"The greatest hazard of barbecuing is that the cook will not us\t enough caution and get burned.  Some people suggest that th\t barbecuing itself is dangerous, because the smoke, which is\t absorbed by the meat, contains benzopyrene, which, in its pure form\t has been known to cause cancer in laboratory animals.  However\t in order to experience the same results, people would have t\t consume unrealistically large quantities of barbecued meat at \t time.-Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.
