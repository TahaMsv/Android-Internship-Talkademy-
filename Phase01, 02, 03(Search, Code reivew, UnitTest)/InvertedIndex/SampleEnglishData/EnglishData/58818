However the paragraphs above seem to repeauncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of "progress" an"rationality" in science.  Since I\'ve addressed these issues in thinewsgroup in the not too distant past, I won't go into them again nowWhat is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives thimpression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhapeven the "correct") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit arounhaving flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies anpetty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position thasciences goes "forward" (and it is not clear what this means given thcontext in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rationaand even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are theweeded out via the "critical function" of science.  (Though why this criticafunction should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mysteryIf experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction arsubject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally truof the application of any "critical function" concerning replicationThis is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it i*not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to havresulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simpldo not generalize well to the actual history of science--Gary H.
