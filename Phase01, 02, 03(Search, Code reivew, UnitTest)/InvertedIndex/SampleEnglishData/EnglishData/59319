I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss. A recent rough tesshowed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps. Then it falls ofa cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on.  This type of loss is difficulto fit. I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids whickeep me roughly functional, but leave a lot to be desiredRecently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids foseveral weeks. These have four independent programs which are intended tbe customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was abouto go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial oanother programmable system called ReSoundUnfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office foabout 30 minutes and I couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the WidexNevertheless, it did appear to me that they were superior and I waimpressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which will give in a separate posting. They also carry the Widex aids and had onpatient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSouneven though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months agoThe problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as thWidex and other programmable aids. I could take a trip to Europe on thdifference!  Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money, I ahaving a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds. I woulappreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projectionabout when and if I might see improvements in technology that aren't quitso expensive-Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon, Eugene, ORUS
