  There is no data to show chromium is effective in promoting weight loss.  Th few studies that have been done using chromium have been very flawed and inheently biased (the investigators were making money from marketing it)  Theoretically it really doesnt make sense either. The claim is that chromiuwill increase muscle mass and decrease fat.  Of course, chromium is also used o cure diabetes, high blood pressure and increase muscle mass in athletes(jusas well as anabolic steroids). Sounds like snake oil for the 1990's :- On the other hand, it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet, and placbo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic..                                    -Pau     ---------------------------------------------------------    |  Paul Sovcik, Pharm.D.
