Hello,  I am not sure if this is the right conference to ask thiquestion, however, Here I go..  I am a commercial fisherman and Ifell about 3 weeks ago down into the hold of the boat and broke ocracked a rib and wrenched and bruised my back and left arm  My question,  I have been to a doctor and was told that it wasbest to do nothing and it would heal up with no long term effect, andindeed I am about 60 % better, however, the work I do is veryhard and I am still not able to go back to work.  The thing that worries mis the movement or "clunking" I feel and hear back there when I movecertain ways...  I heard some one talking about the rib they brokeyears ago and that it still bothers them.\xff.  any opinionsthanx and cheer           jc@oneb.almanac.bc.ca (John Cross     The Old Frog's Almanac  (Home of The Almanac UNIX Users Group)   (604) 245-3205 (v32)    <Public Access UseNet>    (604) 245-4366 (2400x4        Vancouver Island, British Columbia    Waffle XENIX 1.64
