Can someone tell me whether or not any of the following medicationshas been linked to rapid/excessive weight gain and/or a distortedsense of taste or smell:  Hismanal; Azmacort (a topical steroid toprevent asthma); VancenaseAlsoYou may have guessed, I'm an allergy sufferer--but I'm beginning tosuspect I'm also the victim of a Dr. toliberal with the prescriptionp. The allergist I went to last Oct. simply inquired about my symptons( I was suffering chronic asthma attacks), gave me a battery ofallergy tests, and went down a checklist of drugs (a photocopiedsheet).  I've gained out 30 lbs. since then though I haven't eatenmore or much differently than before; I'vsuffered depression; ,fatigue; and I've experienced a foul smell and sense of taste forabout the last two months.  I mentioned the lack of smell and taste tothis Dr. in Feb. and he said my sinuses did look a bit swollen (hejust looked up my nose with his little light--the same one used forears), and prescribed Prednisone and Sulfatrim DS (severe headachesand a rash resulted, particularly after my week's worth of Prednisoneran out).  Now he wants to do a rhinoscopy to see if I have a bleedingulcer or polyps in my sinus cavities.  I'm considering seeing anotherdoctor.  Any suggestions/advice?  I'd really appreciate it
