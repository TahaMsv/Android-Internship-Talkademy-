First off, if I'm not mistaken, only hibernating animals have brown fatnot humansSecondly, your description sounds just like 2,4-dinitrophenol.  This is auncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation.  Put in layman'terms, it short-circuits the mitochondria, causing food energy to bturned into heat2,4-DNP was popular in the 1930's for weight reduction.  In controlleamounts, it raises body temperature as the body compensates for threduced amount of useful energy available.  It is very dangerousIt would be wiser to adjust to your present body form, rather thaplay around with 2,4-DNPBut if you insist, I suggest you look up the literature in your owuniversity library.  You can obtain 2,4-DNP by taking a first yeaorganic chemistry lab course and swiping it from the supplies (it'a commonly-used reagent)
