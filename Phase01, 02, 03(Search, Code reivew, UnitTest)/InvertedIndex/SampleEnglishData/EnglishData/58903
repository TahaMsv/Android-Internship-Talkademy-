I have between 15 and 25 nosebleeds each week, as a result of a genetipredisposition to weak capillary walls (Osler-Weber-Rendu). Fortunatelyeach nosebleed is of short durationDoes anyone know of any method to reduce this frequency? My younger brothereach tried a skin transplant (thigh to nose lining), but their nosebleedsoon returned. I've seen a reference to an herb called Rutin that isupposed to help, and I'd like to hear of experiences with it, or othetechniques--Robert AllisoOttawa, Ontario CANAD
