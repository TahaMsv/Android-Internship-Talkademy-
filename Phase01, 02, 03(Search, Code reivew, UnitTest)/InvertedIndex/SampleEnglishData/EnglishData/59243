\tMy brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet'syndrome. Also called steroid resistant Sweet's syndrome\tThis syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment fohyperthyroidism. She'd been reluctant to have treatment for thhyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustiofrom it.\tI understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid levebut she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist. Her previouendocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. She entered thhospital because of the Sweet's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions)I've looked through the last two years of Medline and didn't find aabstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets. .I checked a handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemiaI'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who traveto New York City. For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinologyAny information that might help. Apparently there hasn't been mucimprovement in her condition over the past several months.-Jackie
