A student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones, cyst on one kidney, and a kidney infection.  She was upset because hecondition had been misdiagnosed since last fall, and she has been ill althis time.  During her most recent doctor's appointment at her parentsHMO clinic, she said that about FORTY! x-rays were made of her kidneyWhen she asked why so many x-rays were being made, she was told by technician that they need to see the area from different views, but shsays that about five x-rays were made from EACH angle.  She couldn't helfeeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something.  Shis a pre-med student and feels she could have understood what wahappening if someone would have explained.  When nobody would, she goworried\tAlso, she is told that thre are 300! surgery patients ahead of heand that they cannot do surgery until August or so.  It is now April..She is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids.  But she has to go tclasses.  She wonders why they have given her no medicine.  She plans tcall back her doctor's office / clinic and try to get answers to thesquestions.  But I told her I would also write in to sci.med and see what could find out about why there were so many x-rays and whether it seemo.k. to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like thior whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care.  She does plan tget a second opinion, too.\tI will pass info on to her.  It never hurts to get informatiofrom more than one source. You can e-mail me or postThanksAlic
