I heard third-hand (not the best form of information) that there was recentlpublished results of a study on Multiple-Personality-Disorder Syndrompatients revealing some interesting clues that the root cause of allergy mahave a psychological trigger or basis.  What I heard about this study was thain one 'personality', a MPDS patient exhibited no observable or clinical signof inhalant allergy (scratch tests were used, according to what I heard)while in other personalities they showed obvious allergy symptoms, includintesting a full ++++ on scratch tests for particular inhalantsIf this is true, it is truly fascinatingBut, I'd like to know if this study was ever done, and if so, what the studreally showed, and where the study is published.
