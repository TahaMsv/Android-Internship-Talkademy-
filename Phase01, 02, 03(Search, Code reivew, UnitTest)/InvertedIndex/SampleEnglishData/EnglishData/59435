Results of their researcwill be reported in the May issue of the scientific journalRadiology   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRIcalled magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team leby Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderlpatients who were believed to be suffering from some form odementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with speciasoftware developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  ClinicaProton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnosein less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical ProtoMRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examinatiotime yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 1minutes.  By comparison, the current "standard of care" in testinfor Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function anneuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to thpatient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy   In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRexam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, includinAIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington'disease   "We\'ve developed a simple test which can be administered quickland relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fittewith either the MRS or PROBE software," said Dr. Ross, adding"this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer\'s earlier anintervene with therapeutics before the progression of the diseascauses further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in thbrain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a markein the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosewith Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while theilevel of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) wasignificantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neuronbelieved to be associated with the progression of the disease   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widelconsidered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Rosbelieves, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by ainterruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine tthe nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 1years, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were baseon the changing receptors for acetylcholine   "Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiatAlzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his oher family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatmenprotocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, wconsider this test a major advancement in medicine," said BrucMiller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcheand a co-author of the study   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. MoatsPh.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne WoolleyR.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,20General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United Statesand will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon   For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the RadiologMay issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart oBelinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877   Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease   What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease othe brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologisAlois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss omemory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personalityloss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death   How many people does it affect   Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults ithe United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, takinapproximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer'debilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, botemotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is thmost common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen everyear, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset   What are its signs and symptoms   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors havbeen identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risof developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 5yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of lifto reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familiaAD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance odeveloping AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe "forgetfulnesscaused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the Schooof Medicine at New York University says "whether forgetfulness ia serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree" ansuggests the following criteria   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently i      normal   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should bevaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other formof dementia -30-Canada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontari416-629-7000/629-704
