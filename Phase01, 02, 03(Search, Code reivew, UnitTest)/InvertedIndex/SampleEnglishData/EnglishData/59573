Note that weight gain is usualla symptom of both. Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroicondition is presentI don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid outputbut I would tend to doubt it. As far as I know clinical depression icaused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and that chemicaimbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body. A regulaeveryday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in thbody at allThe pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSHon the level of circulating Thyroxin (there are two types T3 and T4 one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form ithe liver). The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of othehormones (estrogen, for example). Naturally, changing activity of thbody's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin, buthe liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out ishort orderGood sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual (a physician'reference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-and the Encyclopedia Brittanica (should be available in your localibrary)I hope this has been of some help-Eileen Baue
