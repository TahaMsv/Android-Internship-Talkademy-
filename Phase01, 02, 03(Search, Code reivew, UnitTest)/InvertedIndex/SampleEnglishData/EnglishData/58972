>>I believe it is illegal for a residency to discriminate against FMGs.  Is that true?  I know some that won't even interview FMGs. Most programs discriminate, in that given an FMG equallqualified as an American they will take the American.  Wharights do they actually have?  Does it matter if they arUS citizens (most are not)?  We have had good luck with FMGand bad luck.  SOme of our very best residents have been FMGsAlso, our very worst.  As it turns out, the worst FMGs are ofteUS citizens that studied in off-shore medical schools.  Of th5 residents fired for incompetence in the 12 years I've been herein my department, all have been FMGs.  3 were US citizens who studiedin Guadalajara, 1 was a US citizen but was trained in the Soviet Union,and one was Philipina.  Unfortunately, all are now practicing medicinsomewhere, 3 of them in Neurology after having been picked up byother programs, 1 in psychiatry, and the other in emergency medicine-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, angeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."---------------------------------------------------------------------------
