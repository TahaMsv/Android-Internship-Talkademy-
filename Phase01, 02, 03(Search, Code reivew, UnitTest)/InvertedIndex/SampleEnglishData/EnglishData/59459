Guidleines have been set on the number of dental x-rays and chest x-raysthat one should have over a given period of time because of all theenvironmental factors that can cause cancer in humans, ionizing radiationis one of the most potent(splits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radicalformation in tissue cells).  Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetusin the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumorsin the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue maybe too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists careto comment?)Most stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones,I don\'t think that there are many drugs that can help "dissolve" thekidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesiumhave worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in theaterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation couldspeed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident thata diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgeryis being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A secondopinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to breakup the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO's arenotorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments. My condolences to your friend.Marty B
