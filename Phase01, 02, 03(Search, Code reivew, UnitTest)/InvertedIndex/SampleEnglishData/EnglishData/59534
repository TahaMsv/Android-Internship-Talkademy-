I have several isolation amplifier boards that are the ideal interfacfor EEG and ECG.  Isolation is essential for safety when connectinline-powered equipment to electrodes on the body.  These boardincorporate the Burr-Brown 3656 isolation module that currently sellfor $133, plus other op amps to produce an overall voltage gain o350-400.  They are like new and guaranteed good.  $20 postpaidschematic included.  Please email me for more data--Ken Carve
