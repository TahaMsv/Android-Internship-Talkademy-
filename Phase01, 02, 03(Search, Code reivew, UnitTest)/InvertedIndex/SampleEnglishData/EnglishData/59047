I recently attended an allery seminar.  Steroid Nasal sprays werediscussed.  Afterward on a one-on-one basis, I asked the speaker what ifnone of the Vancanese, Beconase, Nasalide, Nasalcort, or Nasalchrom worknor do any oral decongestants work.  She replied that she saw an article onVasomotor Rhinitis.  That this is not an allergic reaction and that nothingother than the Afrin's and such would work.  (Which in my case is true)I want to find out as much as possible about this, since I am going to seemy allergist in May and want to be armed to the hilt with information;since nothing he has done with me has helped me at all and I have had norelief for 14 monthsPlease respond if you know anything about this and/or please let me knowwhat articles might be helpful that I could look up in the library
