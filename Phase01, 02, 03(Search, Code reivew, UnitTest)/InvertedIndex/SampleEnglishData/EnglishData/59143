Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certaichemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a cell(3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specializeexample), and perhaps other uses.  These electric fields change with locatioand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applyinexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistancecaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures wilbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps notStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundreyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a fetissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce thinvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are somhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speedinthe healing of broken bones, but not understood whyBioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankensteireanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such awhen Volta invented the battery.  I personally don't care to revert to supernaturacause to explain things we don't yet understand
