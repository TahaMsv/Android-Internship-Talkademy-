=Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick.  And EVER=time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food productsWhich points up the "studies" made by amateurs:  Did you ALSO check EVERY TIMYOU DID *NOT* get sick?  "No," you say?  Why not check every thing you eat wheyou don't get sick and find out how much MSG you're actually consuming=> All that's needed now is that final step, a double-blind study don=> on humans.  There isn\'t even an ethical question about "possibl=> harm", as this is a widely used and approved food additive=But - some say that only 2% of the population has a problem with MSG =some say it's more like 20% - but let's say that it's 5%.  How man=people would have to be tested that would have a problem?  Also - =KNOW I have a problem with it, and I wouldn't VOLUNTEER for a testIf you knew enough about what the test was about to decide that you didn't wanto participate because it involved MSG, you'd've already made yourselineligible (since MSG IS detectable by taste). How can anybody be so cluelesas to what double blind studies are all about-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Carl J Lydick | INTERnet: CARL@SOL1.GPS.CALTECH.EDU | NSI/HEPnet: SOL1::CARDisclaimer:  Hey, I understand VAXen and VMS.  That's what I get paid for.  Munderstanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level (or below).  Sunless what I'm saying is directly related to VAX/VMS, don't hold me or morganization responsible for it.  If it IS related to VAX/VMS, you can try thold me responsible for it, but my organization had nothing to do with it
