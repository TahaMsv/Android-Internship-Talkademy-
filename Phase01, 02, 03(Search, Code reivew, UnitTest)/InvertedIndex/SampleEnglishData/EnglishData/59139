I'm looking for good background and review paper references that can help munderstand the dynamics of cytoskeleton in normal and transformed cells.  Iparticular, I'm not interested in translational behavior and cell motilitybut rather in the internal motions of the cytoskeleton and its componentunder normal and transformed circumstancesAlso, I'd appreciate any data on force constants, mechanical, and elastiproperties of microtubules, and viscous properties of cytoplasm.  Any otheinfo relevant to the vibrational or acoustical properties of these woulbe useful to meThanks..Bill Christens-Barrcerulean@access.digex.co
