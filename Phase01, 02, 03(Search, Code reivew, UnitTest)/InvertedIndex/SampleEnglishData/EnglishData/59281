I know that there is a relationship between Fibromyalgia and deepsleep.  I believe that there are five levels of sleep.  I thinkthat R.E.M. sleep is the third deepest level of sleep and thatthere are two deeper levels of sleep.  If I am in error in any ofthis, please let me knowWhich level of sleep is thought to be deficient in people withFibromyalgia?  Are there any known sleep disturbances associatedwith CFS?  What sleep disturbances (if any) are associated withclinical depression?  Do antidepressants correct the sleepdisturbances in these diseases?  Are there any good books ormedical journal articles about sleep disturbances and thesediseases?  Thank you in advance for all replies...
