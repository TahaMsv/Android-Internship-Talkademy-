rousseaua@immunex.com writes about heat shock proteins (HSP's) and DNAI hate to be derogatory, but in this case I think it's warrantedHSP's are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason theare called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrateusing heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANprotein- because it's DEAD! Also, who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will becompletely digested in your stomach, which is about pH 2. Some of you worry WAY too much.  Eat a healthy, balanced diet and relaxMy advice is, if you don't know what you are talking about, it is betteto keep your mouth shut than to open it and remove all doubt about youignorance.
