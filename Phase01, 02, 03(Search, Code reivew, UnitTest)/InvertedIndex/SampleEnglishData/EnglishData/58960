(This type of problem also occurs with stove-top pagrilling.)  One possible remedy I have read about is to take some vitamin C with your meal of barbecue (or bacon, e.g.).  This MAY make sense because vit. is an antioxidant which could counteract the adverse affect of some of thechemicals in question.
