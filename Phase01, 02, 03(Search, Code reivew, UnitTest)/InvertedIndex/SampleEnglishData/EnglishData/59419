I used to be on lopid.  It did a good job of reducing cholesterol (29down to around 214), as well as LDL and triglycerides.  Then, I gopneumonia, and for some reason, the Lopid stopped working very wellcholesterol and triglycerides soared.  The levels might have stabilizeover time, but a new doctor had me quit, wait a month, then switcto Mevicore. On Mevicore, my total cholesterol was down to 207,  LDL was 108,and HDL was 35; but the trig's were stilvery high, around 318, and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal,SGOT = 83 (N = 1-35),  GGTP(?hard to read copy) = 42 (N = 0 - 35)He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause hiconcern, and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterofigures.  He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal ("Justo be extra cautious, though I\'m sure it\'s not a problem.")and wants me to go back on it after that.  I suggested maybe Lopid mighbe the better choice, and he said that he wouldn't object if that's whaI want to do.  But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond ofShould the above liver and trig figures be feared?  What happens tfolks with high trig levels?  Is my liver in danger with the abovresults?  Would I be better off on Lopid, despite its inconvenientside effect, or, perhaps, some other drug?  (Niacin affected myliver, too)
