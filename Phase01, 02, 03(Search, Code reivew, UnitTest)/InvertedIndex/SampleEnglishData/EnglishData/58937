>   OTOH, who are we kidding, the New England Medical Journal in 198>   ran the heading: "Ninety Percent of Diseases are not Treatable b>   Drugs or Surgery," which has been echoed by several other reports>   No wonder MDs are not amused with alternative medicine, sinc>   the 20% magic of the "placebo effect" would award alternative>   practitioners twice the success rate of conventional medicine..1: "90% of diseases" is not the same thing as "90% of patients"   In a world with one curable disease that strikes 100 people, and nin   incurable diseases which strikes one person each, medical science will cur   91% of the patients and report that 90% of diseases have no therapy2: A disease would be counted among the 90% untreatable if nothing better tha   a placebo were known.  Of course MDs are ethically bound to not knowingl   dispense placebos..-d
