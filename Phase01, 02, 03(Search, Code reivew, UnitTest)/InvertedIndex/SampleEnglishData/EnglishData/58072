\tA friend has the following symptoms which have occurred periodicallevery few months for the last 3 years.  An episode begins with extremtiredness followed by\t1. traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows\tknees, and hips\t2. generalized muscle pain\t3. tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ear\t4. severe sweating occuring both at night and during the da\t5. hemorrhaging in both eyes.  Her opthamologist calls it periphera   retinal hemorhages and says it looks similar to diabetic retinopathy.  (Sh        isn't diabetic--they checked\t6. distorted color vision and distorted vision in general (telephon\t   poles do not appear to be straight\t7. loss of peripheral vision \\tMany tests have been run and all are normal except for somethingcalled unidentified bright objects found on a MRI of her brain.  The onlthing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone.  Atimes she had been on 60 mg per day.  Whenever she gets down to 10-15 mthe symptoms become acute again\tShe is quite concerned because the retinal hemorrhages are becominworse with each episode and her vision is suffering.  None of the docs shhas seen have any idea what this condition is or what can be done to stoit.  Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks inadvance.  Kathy Turne\
