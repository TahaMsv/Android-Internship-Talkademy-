=>Greg:Flame definitely intended here.  Bill was making fun of the misspelling.=>Go look up the word "krill."  Also, the correct spelling is Kirlian.  I=>involves taking photographs of corona discharges created by attaching th=>subject to a high-voltage source, not of some "aura."  It works equally wel=>with inanimate objects=True.. but what about showing the missing part of a leaf?  Is thi="corona discharge"Yup.  The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf betweethe plates, and taking a Kirlian photograph of it.  You then cut off part othe leaf, put the top plate back on, and take another Kirlian photograph.  Yosee pretty much the same image in both cases.  Turns out the effect isn'nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates betweephotographs.  Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the placconducts electricity.
