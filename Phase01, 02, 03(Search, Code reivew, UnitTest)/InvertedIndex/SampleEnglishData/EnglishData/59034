Ther>is a book "The Yeast Connection" which talks about this "illness">There is no convincing evidence that such a disease existsThere's a lot of evidence, it just hasn't been adequately gathered anpublished in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skepticwho quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is usedFor example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book "Sinus Survival", always givesbefore any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to hinew patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more timein the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results, and for over2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relieof allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for hiprogramIn my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classisymptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorlywritten book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. whicI never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosagof Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I canow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm als*greatly* improved in other areas as wellOf course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic tmolds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out thaif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have natural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where yowould have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of variousorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize thasuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinusince that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,00question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I wafrom over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of thstress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeascolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer sinctesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has ttake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relativelsafe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there'no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasonsBTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphatoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll fina lot of people who are on Nystatin all the timeIn summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keemedicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmlto the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enougactually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to mface that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantetheir safety.  For their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified afar as I am concernedJon Norin--Charter Member --->>>  INFJ ClubIf you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info============================================================================| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          | JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE | 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    | Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          ============================================================================Who are you?
