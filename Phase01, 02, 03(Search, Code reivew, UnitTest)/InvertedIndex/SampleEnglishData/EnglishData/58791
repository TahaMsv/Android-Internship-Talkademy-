It came "out of nowhere."  The connectioKekule saw between it and his problem is fortunate but not extraordinaryI, for example, often receive/conjure solutions (hypotheses for solutions)to my everyday problems at moments when I appear to myself to be occupiedwith activities quite removed.

I'll swear I amnot thinking about any of it when ideas come.
