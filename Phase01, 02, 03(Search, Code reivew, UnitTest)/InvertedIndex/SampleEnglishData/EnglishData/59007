Ideally, every meal should contain something from at least twof these four groups.  Food DOES serve functions other than nutrition, anone of them is keeping the organism happy and thus aiding its immunsystem.And I didn't spend a million bucks commissioning a study that told me tredraw my silly little pyramid in different colors and with a friendlietypeface, either.

That seems quitunrealistic--unrealistically SMALL.  And a few slabs of ribs from the EasTexas Smoker (RIP, again) in Louisville is not at all unrealistic either. What say we have a rec.food.cooking dinner at the Moonlite Bar-B-Que Inn iOwensboro? (It's all you can eat including lamb ribs & mutton for abou$10.)  We could invite Julie Kangas as guest of honor and see if thMoonlite's Very Hot Sauce is too hot for her.  (It IS too hot for me, and don't say that very often.)  And she could bring ice cream with crushedried chiltepins for dessert. And we could see if there IS such a thing as an "unrealistically largquantity" of barbecue--the owner of the Moonlite estimates that thOwensboro restaurants serve a hundred thousand pounds of meat a week in thsummer, and forty thousand in the winter--in a town of 50 000 or so.  Twpounds per person per week?   Again, sure sounds unrealistic to me--thatjust too meager to be healthy~ Kiran (Now a two-pound slab of ribs a day, THAT's realistic.--FUZZY PINK NIVEN'S LAW:  Never Waste Calories.
