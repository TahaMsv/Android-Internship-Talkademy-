I am writing this to find out the following1.)\tAny information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis2.)\tThe name(s) of a doctor(s) who specialize in such surgery3.)\tInformation on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancerMy boyfriend, age 34 and otherwise in good health, was diagnosed withreflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago.  At that time hesaw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (Mylanta,Tagamet), as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed. These treatments were not effective and because the damage wasworsening, he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago.  He was toldthere were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a Nissenwrap and a "Hill Repair".  He opted for the "Hill Repair". He recoveredvery well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worseand in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva)The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed himthat a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous conditionwhich he called "Barrett\'s Syndrome". If he can\'t avoid having reflux willhe necessarily get cancerBasically, if anyone has any information on what he should do now, I'dappreciate itThanksPat Lydon/ NetManage, Inc./ Pat@netmanage.co
