Reproduced without permission.Digression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste ReceptorAlthough the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practicalltasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miraclberries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors isuch a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile,Moskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miraclberry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to tastsour as wellMiraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as diet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculipill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Sucsubstances would taste sweet without providing many caloriesA colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berriesWe drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasteextremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  Weawoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers[... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ...Refs: Bartoshuk, L.M., Gentile, R.L., Moskowitz, H.R., & Meiselman, H.L.
