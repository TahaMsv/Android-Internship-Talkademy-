It wasonly a few minutes later while driving home that I remembered that yourmessage does specifically say cortical.  My first reaction had been to suggesthe PC12 pheochromocytoma line.  That may still be a good compromise, dependinon what you're doing.  Have you concidered using a mouse cell line from oneof the SV40 T antigen transgenic lines?  Another alternative might be primarcells from bovine adrenal cortex. Mik
