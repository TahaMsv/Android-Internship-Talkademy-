I'm a nursing student, and I would like to respond to #66966 on haldoand the elderlyMessage-ID: <25APR199316225142@fsphy1.physics.fsu.eduOrganization: Florida State University - School of Higher ThoughNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.4-b1 First, I'm sorry to hear that you have had to see your grandmother gthrough this.  I know it has to have been toughThere are many things that can cause long term confusion in elderladults.  The change in environment can cause problems.  Anesthetic agentcan cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out othe body as easily.  In addition, medications and interactions betweemedications can cause confusionAs far as whether or not haldol can have long lasting effects even aftethe drug has been discontinued, I do not know.  I have not _seen_ anythinto that effect.  However, I also had not been looking for that informationI can see what I can find..I can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug, and, according tthe Nursing93 Drug handbook, it is "Especially useful for agitatioassociated with senile dementia"  (p. 400).  It also should not bediscontinued abruptly.  It did not say anything about long lastineffectsBecause so many things can cause confusion, it is hard for me to knowhat else was going on at the time; if I had more history, i might be ablto answer you better.  If you want to send me e-mail with more informationI would be happy to try to  help you piece together what might havhappenedElispicl25@fsphy1.physics.fsu.ed
