My husband woke up three days ago with a small sore spo(a spot about the size of a nickel) on one of his testicles. Bottom sideno knots or lumps, just a little sore spot.  He says it reminds him ofhow a bruise feels.  He has no recollection of hitting it or anything likthat that would cause a bruise. (He asssures me he'd remember somethinlike that :-)Any clues as to what it might be?  He's somewhat of a hypochondriac (sp?so he's sure he's gonna die. .
