THAT MSG CORRECTSI REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND!!ALSO ... Nitrosiamines (sp) and sulfites...   Why them?  There ar safer ways to preserve food, wines, and beersI think1) outlaw the use of these substances without warning labels alarge as those on cig. packages2) Require 30% of comparable products on the market to be free of thessubstances and state that they are free of MSG, DYES, NITROSIAMINES and SULFITES on the package3) While at it outlaw yellow dye #5.  For that matter why dye food? 4) Take the dyes and flavorings out of vitamins.
