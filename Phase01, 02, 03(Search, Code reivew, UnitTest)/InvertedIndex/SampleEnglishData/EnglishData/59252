Gee, I have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes aboumyself, my friends, and my family, but in the practice omedicine I expect and demand more rigorous rationales fobasing therapy than "Aunt Susie\'s brother-in-law ..."Anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesisbut rarely proves anything in a positive sense.
