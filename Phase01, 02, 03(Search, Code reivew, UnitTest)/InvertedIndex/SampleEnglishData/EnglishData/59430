Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning thfollowing two health problemsFirst, I was recently diagnosed (using a UGI series) as having Schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. As I understand itthe hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionallhave some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzkring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particularif I'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing foodfood occasionally gets "stuck" before reaching my stomach. This resultin a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstructionFortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoyingand causes frequent discomfortMy doctor wants to "dilate" the ring using thfollowing procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomacfor any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passinsome kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to knoif anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if sowas it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment osafety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it becoma common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-soundinprocedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as thisespecially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforationreaction to anesthesia)The second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large numbeof "extra" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so therhas been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 2hrs, along with a few PAC's. (Many days, there are far more than thishowever-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologisindicated that such a number was "normal". It certainly doesn\'feel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes oextended "runs" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to caussevere light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in goohealth (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs ocaffeine, etc. I\'m willing to accept the extra beats as "normal", but don\'want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The numbeof PVC's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or somethinas simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lyindown for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possiblbe related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about thsame timeThanks for any help/advice============================================================================================================================================================
