There is no question thaorally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly alneurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the mediaeminence. These areas are responsible for the production ohormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normadevelopment of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Nowhat, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brainecessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missingAre you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitaryANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible focontrolling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone?How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical t"sacrifice" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doseof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The fooindustry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicinand psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would buseful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies opsychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude anphysiologyI suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivitie(You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and itimplication for adults (me).  Certainlthe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger thafor the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copiouand increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and theihidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyonwant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb thendocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levelsattained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC.>>Between who? Over what?

Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that oralladministered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormonfluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistansupression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transienrelease of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH iresponsible not only for control of growth during development, bualso converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause oheadaches? I don't know>>>dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com>>Hmm. ".com".
