I live at sea-level, and am called-upon to travel to high-altitude citiequite frequently, on business.  The cities in question are at 7000 to 900feet of altitude.  One of them especially is very polluted..Often I feel faint the first two or three days.  I feel lightheaded, anmy heart seems to pound a lot more than at sea-level.  Also, it is verdry in these cities, so I will tend to drink a lot of water, and keeaway from dehydrating drinks, such as those containing caffeine or alcoholThing is, I still have symptoms.  How can I ensure that my short trips ther(no, I don't usually have a week to acclimatize) are as comfortable as possibleIs there something else that I could doA long time ago (possibly two years ago) there was a discussion here aboualtitude adjustment.  Has anyone saved the messagesMany thanksVida
