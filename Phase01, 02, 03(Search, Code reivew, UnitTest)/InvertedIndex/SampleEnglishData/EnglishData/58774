I don\'t believe youI am told (by the person who I care a lot about and who I am worrieis going to start putting his health and money into homeopathy withoureally knowing what he is getting into and who is the reason I postein the first place about homeopathy) that in Britain homeopathy iavailable on the National Health Service and that there are about 600GPs who use homeopathic practices. True? False? WhatHave there been any important and documented investigations inthomeopathic principlesI was reading a book on homeopathy over the weekend. I turned to thsection on the principles behind homeopathic medicine, and twparagraphs informed me that homeopaths don't feel obliged to providany sort of explanation.

Iit because I am a narrow-minded bigot, or is it because homeopathreally looks more like witch-doctory than anything elseDaniele
