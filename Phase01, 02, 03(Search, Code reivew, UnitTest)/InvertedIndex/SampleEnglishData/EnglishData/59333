Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease thefrequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of thecandida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilusshould be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through theintestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access tooxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in thelay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, I'm reallyamazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it outThe calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw allconventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be ifconventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standardmedical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trialsThe clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a veryimportant one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteriaafter antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reasonto dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaplyand safely(like it is in animal husbandry)Marty B
