Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans doDomestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an ideamy family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-greatgrandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wifhad each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-greatgrandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperoufarmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors ochildbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakotacontain quite a few gravestones like "Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, anbaby, May 6, 1853.>You wante>to section all women carrying breech in case one in a hundred or >thousand breech babies get hung up in second stageMore like one in ten.
