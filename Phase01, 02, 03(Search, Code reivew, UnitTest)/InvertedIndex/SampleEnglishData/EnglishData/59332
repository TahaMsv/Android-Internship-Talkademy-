L.acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarilyresponsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most ofthe commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L.bulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with aremuch more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has toldme through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and severaldifferent obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn'ttold me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultativeanaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given achance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteriaaround will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the analregion or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candidablooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise fromthe evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I dobelieve that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lowercolon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes thecompeting bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow uncheckedRestoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to getrid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin Asupplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until thegood bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower thepH to basically starve the candida outMarty B
