Getting back to the original question in this threadI experienced breathing difficulties a few years ago similar to thosdescribed.  In my case, it turned out that I was developing Type diabetes.  Although I never sought direct confirmation of this from mdoctor, I think that the breathing problem was associated with thpresence of ketones due to the diabetesI think that ketosis can occur in lesser degree if one is restrictintheir food intake drastically.
