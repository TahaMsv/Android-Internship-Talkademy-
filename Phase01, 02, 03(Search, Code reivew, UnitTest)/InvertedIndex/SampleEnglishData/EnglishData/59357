I think you must have the same hygiene teacher I had in 1955.  Thereis a story about the Civil War about a soldier who was shot in thgroin.  The bullet, after passing through one of his testes, then enterethe abdomen of a young woman standing nearby.  Later,  when she (a younwoman of unimpeachible virtue) was shown to be pregnant; the soldier dithe honorable thing of marrying her.  According to this story, they livehappily ever after. Perhaps the most famous of Mr. Rau's classes was the time he would cominto class brandishing an aluminum turning mandrel  (tapering from abou3/8" to 1/2" over a 10 inch length).  He would say, "Boys, do you knowhat this is?  It's a medical instrument called a 'cock reamer' and it'used to unclog your penis when you have VD.  They just ram it up therwithout an anesthetic!"  Needless to say this had a chilling effectI didn't have lascivious thoughts for at least an hour.  Later in lifas I perused medical instrument catelogs and saw the slender flexiblurethral sounds that are actually used, I could not escape thinkinthat I might one day see, "Reamer, Cock (style of Rau) ."
