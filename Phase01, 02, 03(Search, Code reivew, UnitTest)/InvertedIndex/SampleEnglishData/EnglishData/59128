There do noseem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  ThCopenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBstudies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aurabut like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBFFrom one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because ithe absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  Froanother (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain othe specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headachetherefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologicWhether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disablinheadaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologicolleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patientthey can get.  Working on a salary, however, I would rather not filmy office with patients holding their heads in pain-- . SLMR 2.1 .
