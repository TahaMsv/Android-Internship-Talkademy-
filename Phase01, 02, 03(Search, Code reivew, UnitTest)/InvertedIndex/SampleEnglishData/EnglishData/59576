Sounds like snake oil for the 1990's :-Where are your references?  I have been unable to find studies that statthat chromium "cures diabetese".  It can reduce the amount of insulin yohave to take.  "High blood pressure" - I have never heard of this claibefore.  "... anabolic steroids" - I have also never heard of this claibefore.  Sounds like you are making things up and stretching the trutfor God knows what reason.

But it can be the decisive componenof an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make aimportant contribution to good health.  It is important texercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10)Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increaslean muscle (1, 2, 3).  I will not bore you with thstatistics.  You wouldn't believe these anywayChromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source othe essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital rolin "sensitizing" the body\'s tissues to the hormone insulinWeight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivitto insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to losweight (4)Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retardprotein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  This "protein sparingeffect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie dietas insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscland organ tissue.  By "sensitizing" muscle to insulinchromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieterso that they "burn" more fat and less muscle.  Preservatioof lean body mass has an important long-term positiveffect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off thfat they've lostChromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aidinthe thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulinInsulin levels serve as a rough index of the availabilitof food calories, so it's not at all surprising that insulinstimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  Note that I did not sathat chromium picolinate increases metabolismIn summary, you need to change your life style in order tloose weight and stay healthy  A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories     - Eating fat makes you fat  B. Increase dietary fibe     - low in calories; high in nutrients  C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a wee     - burn calories  D. Take chromium picolinate dail     - lose fat; keep musclReferences1.  Kaats GR, Fisher JA, Blum K.
