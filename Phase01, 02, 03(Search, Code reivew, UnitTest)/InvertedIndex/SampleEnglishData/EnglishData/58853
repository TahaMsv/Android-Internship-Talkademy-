-*---I agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post ithis thread.

One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoninabout empirical investigation lies in understanding the contextscope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces oevidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break thback of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to bfilled in, and some are trivial in their importance.

According to these posters  "If it\'s not supported b> carefully designed controlled studies then it\'s not science.These posters are making the mistake that I have previouslcriticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A "carefulldesigned and controlled study" is neither always possible noalways important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, whave enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kinof claim to ask for a "carefully designed and controlled studyto alleviate our skepticism.Rules such as "support the hypothesis by a carefully designed ancontrolled study" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigationI think that the requirements for particular reasoning to bconvincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that havoccurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (Treuse the previous example, we know that conclusions frouncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medicaproblems are notoriously problematic.) Russel
