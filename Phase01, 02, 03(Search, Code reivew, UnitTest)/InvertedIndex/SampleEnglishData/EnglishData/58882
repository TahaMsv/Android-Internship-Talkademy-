     Gordon Rubenfeld responds to Ron RothGR>  ron.roth@rose.com (ron roth) wroteGRGR> RR> Well, Gordon, I look at the RESULTS, not at anyone's *scientificGR> RR> stamp of approvalGR> GR>    If you and your patients (followers?) are convinced (as you've writtenGR>  by your methods of uncontrolled, undocumented, unreported, unsubstantiatedGR>  subjective endpoint research - great.  But, why should the rest of us care Gordon, even if you are trying to beat this issue to death, you'll never get more than a stalemate out of this one I have never tried to force my type of medicine on any of you. Why should I?  My patients are happy. I'm happy. You and your peers seem to be the only miserable ones around bemoaning the steady loss of patients to the alternative camp Just look at Europe. There has been a steady exodus from 'synthetic' medicine for over a decade now, and it'll be just a matter of tim before more people on this continent will abandon their drug and white coat worship as well and visit different doctors for different needsGR>     You see Ron, the point isn't whether YOU and your patients arGR>  convinced that whatever it is you do works; it's whether what you do iGR>  MORE effective in similar cases (of whatever it is you think you arGR>  treating) than cupping, bloodletting, and placebo This is very interesting. I have come exactly to the same conclusion but in regards to *conventional* medicine You see, I don't just treat little old ladies that wouldn't know an different of what is being done, but a bulk of my patients consist o teachers, lawyers, judges, nurses, accountants, university graduates and various health practitioners If these people have gotten results with my method after having bee unsuccessful with yours or their own, I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over whether you or your peers approve of my treatments --- let\'s face it, with all the blunders committed by "scientific" MDs over the years, I know a lot of people who hold your *scientific* method in much lower esteem than they hold mineGR>  As far as we know ayurveda = crystals = homeopathy = Ron RotGR>  which may all equal placebo administered with appropriatGR>  trappings..      Sorry, but I'm not familiar OR interested with what appears to be 'NEW AGE' medicine (ayurveda, crystals), with the exception of homeo pathy, of which I took a course. But Gordon, you already knew that  you just wanted to make my system look a bit more far out, right I use homeopathy very little, since my cellular test (EMR) is hard t beat for accuracy and minerals are more predictable, while homeopath does have a problem with reliability, especially in acute conditions An exception perhaps are homeopathic nosodes which act fairly quickl and are more dependable in certain viral or bacterial situations.GR>  My colleagues and I spend hours debating study desigGR>  and results, even of therapies currently accepted as "standard"GR>  As good (well, adequate) scientists, we are prepared, *ifGR>  presented with appropriate data*, to abandon our most deeply heldGR>  beliefs in favor of new ideas I have met the challenges of hundreds of sceptics by verifying th accuracy of measuring their mineral status to their total satisfac tion --- in other words EVERYONE INVOLVED is happy If you were to cook a meal, would you worry over whether EVERYONE in this world would find it to their liking, or only those that end up eating it Since I have financed every research project that I have undertaken entirely myself, I don't need to follow any of your rules or guide lines to satisfy any aspects of a grant application, which YOU may have to; neither am I concerned of whether or not my study designs meet your or anyone else's criteria or acceptance.GR>    Sorry Ron, if conviction were the ruler of truth, a flat Earth woulGR>  still be the center of the Universe and epilepsy a curse of the gods                         I think there would be more justification for an uneducated perso growing up in an uncivilized environment to believe in a flat earth than for a civilized, well educated and scientifically trained min to follow the doctrine of evolution Genetic engineering of course is now the final frontier to show Go how it is (properly) done. Now we've become capable of creating ou own paradise and give disease (and God) the boot, right But just before we get rid of Him for good, perhaps He could leave u some pointers on how to solve a couple of tiny problems, such as war, poverty, racism, crime, riots, substance abuse... And one last thing, could He also give us a hint on how to control natural disasters, th weather, and last, but not least --- peace   --Ron---   RoseReader 2.00  P003228:  The Lab called: Your brain is ready   RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-536
