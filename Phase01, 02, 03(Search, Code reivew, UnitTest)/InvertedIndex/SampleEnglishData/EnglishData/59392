I'm a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much better.  I applieto about 20 schools, got two interviews, got one offer, and am waiting thear from the other schoolLet me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medicaschool admissions process.  Numbers (GPA, MCATs) are not everything,but they are probably more important than anything else.  In fact, somschools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even looat your other qualities.  Of course, when this happens, don't expect a refunon your $50 application feeBut, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numberand are very well qualified academically.  You mentioned one response, was ian acceptance, denial, or wait-list?  If I assume the worst, that it was denial, then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere.  Hodid your interviews goAs for how long you have to wait, I've called a few schools who never contacteme for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them waover and that if I haven't heard by now, I can assume a denial.  Many rejectioletters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools arstill interviewing. I really don't think you should worry.  Don't becomfixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourselfWhat do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a vermediocre GPA, but high MCAT scores, and I have been working as a softwarengineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.  StillI think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitteis something like thisVERY IMPORTAN-------------GPA:\t3.5 or betteMCAT:   top 15% in all subjecMEDIUM IMPORTANC----------------Writing/Speaking abilitMaturitMotivation for going into medicinActivitieLESS IMPORTAN-------------College or UniversitMajoWork experiencAnything else you want them to knoAnyway, you are in good shape.  I think admissions committees are bound imany ways by the numbers, but would like very much to understand eacperson as an individual.  Sometimes thats just not practical.  But gettingfour interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers.  Hopefully, yowere able to impress them with your characterGood luckJef
