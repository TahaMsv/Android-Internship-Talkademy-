Pediatrics for me was three soli> months of illness, and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam>> I think what happens is that during training, and beyond, we are constantl> exposed to new things, and we have the usual reactions to them, so that late> on, when challenged with something, it is more likely a re-exposure for us> so we deal with it well and get a mild illness.This is also commonly seen in new teachers.
