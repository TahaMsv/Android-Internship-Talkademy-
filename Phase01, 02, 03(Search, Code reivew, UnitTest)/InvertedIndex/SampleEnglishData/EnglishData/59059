I have become involved in a project to further develop andimprove the performance of SPECT (Single Photon EmissioComputerized Tomography) imaging.  We will eventually havto peddle this stuff somewhere, and so as I move this thinalong, I would like to know -What is the current resolution of SPECT imaging?  What kindof jobs is SPECT used for, specifically?  What kind of specific jobcould I hopthat SPECT could be used for, if its resolution improvedsay, to close to that of PET (Positron Emission Tomography)And how much does a SPECT machine cost?  How much does a singlSPECT image cost? If anyone knows the answer to any or all of these questions, Owhere I could find that answer, I would be very grateful, indeed. Thanks in advance for any replie\t\t\t\t\tDave Elieze\t\t\t\t\teliezer@physics.llnl.go
