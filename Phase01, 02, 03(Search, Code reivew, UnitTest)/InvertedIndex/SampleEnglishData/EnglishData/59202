Would that many patients be able to tell whacauses them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, buif a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods aretested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohn'commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up witseverly restricted diets that take months to renormalizeThere was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussethe issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  It would be worth readinto anyone with an interest in Crohn'sAnd, as I always say when dealing with Crohn's, as does Spencer, Good LuckSteve Hollan
