Does anyone know of any studies done on the long-term health effects of man's vasectomy on his female partnerI've seen plenty of study results about vasectomy's effects on men's healthbut what about women?For example, might the wife of a vasectomized man become more at risk forsay, cervical cancer?  Adverse effects from sperm antibodies?  Changes in thvagina's pH?  Yeast or bacterial infectionsOutside of study results, how about informed speculationThanks in advance for your help-Eric Skagerberg        <eskagerb@nermal.santarosa.eduSanta Rosa, California        Telephone (707) 573-146
