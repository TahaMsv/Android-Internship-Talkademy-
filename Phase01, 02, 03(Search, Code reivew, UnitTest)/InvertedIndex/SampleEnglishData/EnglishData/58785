I've eaten Chinese food for ages and never had problems. I wenwith some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest. and they orderelots of stuff I had never seen before. The only thing I can remember of thameal was the first course, scallops served in the shell with a soy-type sauceI thought, "Well, I\'ve only had scallops once and I was sick after but thacould have been a coincidence". That night as I sat on the bathroom floorsweating and emptying my stomach the hard way, I decided I would never toucanother scallop. I may not be allergic but I don't want to take the chanceAmy Mossma
