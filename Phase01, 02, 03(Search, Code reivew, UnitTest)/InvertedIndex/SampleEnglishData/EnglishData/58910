>-*--->I agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post i>this thread. Gee!  Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with somethingI say can't be all bad.  ;-Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect. I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that scienceis mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with yourcontention that nobody who doesn\'t use methods deemed "scientific"can possibly know what's true and what's not. >  [Deleted material which I agree with.] >Back to Lee Lady>> These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med an>> sci.psychology.

Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degreesof certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefullycontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to theextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certaintreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, evenif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement thaa treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope fofrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate supportIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as crediblbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who arqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testingSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards ofevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal. I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (anoccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Mucof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized ainformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For yearnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists tjust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some othe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not fothe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at thNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information frosubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be oscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of th*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientifiinvestigationOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  "If thihasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empiricaresearch then it can\'t be of any interest to us." To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme "There\'ve got tbe controlled studies" position is an NLP technique called the FasPhobia/Trauma CureSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's mostimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is thatit doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tellwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simplevisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim thait can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence iuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentialla variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioratherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique onc(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  Thprocess doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need tpractice it over again at homeNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.) Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them upto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up tothe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in afew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long termfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of vieweven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the bestof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversedafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was donwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the FastPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17tfloor of my building and having a large balcony.) The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not tmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome studwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can illafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, becausethe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of thscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gainfrom scientific acceptance.)The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinicalpsychology establishment is still saying "We don\'t have any way ofknowing that it\'s effective." These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborateas anyone could want, of course, but they say  "Why should I prove yourtheory?"  and  "The burden of proof is on the one making the claim." One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completelyunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn'tbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number ofbooks and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as muchdetail as I'm capable of.) Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (withfavorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journalTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it. This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about "doctrinnaire"attitudes about science. Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell. If so, I apologize.-In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seemsless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.  lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitne
