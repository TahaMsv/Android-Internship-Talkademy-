Last year, I was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed ainguinal hernia.  I couldn't remember doing anything that would havcaused it.  That is, I hadn't been lifting more than other people doand in fact probably somewhat less.  Eventually the thing became morpainful and I had the repair operationThis year I developed a pain on the other side.  This turned out to banother inguinal hernia.  So I go back to the hospital Monday foanother fun 8-) operationI don't know of anything I'm doing to cause this to happen.  I'm 3years old and I don't think I'm old enough for things to start fallinapart like this.  The surgeon who is doing the operation seems tsuspect a congenital weakness, but if so, why did it suddenly appeawhen I was 37 and not really as active as I was when I was youngerDoes anyone know how to prevent a hernia, other than not liftinanything?  It's rare that I lift more than my 16-month-old or a sacfull of groceries, and you may have noticed that your typical grocersack is fairly small these days.  Is there some sort of exercise thawill reduce the riskOf course, my wife thinks it's from sitting for long periods of time athe computer, reading news..--J.
