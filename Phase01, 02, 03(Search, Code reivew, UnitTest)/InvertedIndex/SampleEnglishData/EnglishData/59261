It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  calledFamilies USA      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believethat doctors make too much money     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  forphysicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would beOK     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentmentand envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaignand are still simmering     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group thatearns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majorityof Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  whodo are stealing it from them     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself. Karl Marx lives     It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  suchas:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  tobecome a physician     If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they shouldhave  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  theyshould have been dropped.   What good are their views on how mucha doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become adoctor     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  "Howmuch  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellentgrades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  orderto (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  takingcourses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work andmaintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  yearsof  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourthyears in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e)put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training,depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  indebt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60hours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  ormore until they retire or fall over?     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerablymore  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  andClinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  havecalled together to remake America's health care     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  farmore useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing,social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that isto health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates,many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  themajor cause of high medical costs     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be. Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible forour longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers ina McDonald's     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  becomea  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couchcabbages     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  orSuper  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   Butinstead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain,they might have been more honest if they had said     "Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggestproblems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes,you,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  youguzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack;getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  themicrowave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies intothe  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshotvictims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  diseasewhile blaming the world for not finding an instant cure     "You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  singlebiggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  isamazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do     "In fact,  I don\'t understand how they can stand looking  atyour blubbery bods all day     "So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  andstart living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesygreasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid,there is another solution: Don't use them     That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of thosespine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his handsupon your head and declare you fit     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chestpains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slitthere, and pop in a couple of valves     You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  thatoverpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  housethan  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  andmalpractice insurance than you will ever earn)     Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it. And if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book onhow to give it its shots     By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  muchpollsters should earnRoyko  is  a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for  Tribune  MediaServices___________________________________________________________________________-*********************************************Vinay J.
