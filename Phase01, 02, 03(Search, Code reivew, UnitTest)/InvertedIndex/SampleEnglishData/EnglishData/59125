Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems. It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the HewlettPackard Scanners. When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options;(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3)automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image.I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select whichparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what orderOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  Thesoftware gives you two "errors" at this point.  Blue which are words that wereconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary. Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it convertedcorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself morecredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue,you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personaldictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited,considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary.After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of wordprocessor formats.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system hasbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g.,Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus,Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidencesof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera,malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore,control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drugresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease,salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerginginfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, thosein institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), andminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden ofemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by moreeffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs(3).     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, "Emerging InfectiousDiseases." Future articles will address these diseases, as well assurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers andpublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigationof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4).Reference1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department ofHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and anincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, acase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea orpostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controlsimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurantswas initiated.     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during JanuaryFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to thestate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the casedefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person withconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset ofsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain Arestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patientswho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eatinga regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years(range: 0-74 years). Idaho     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health,Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with cultureconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons werehospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services wasnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died.Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons withE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993.Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant andHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak wasreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27%increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined aspostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured,or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, withonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993.     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). Theoutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteenpersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The medianage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study ofthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched communitycontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matchedOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patientswho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regularsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3).Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eatenat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health Districtissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrheacontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloodydiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illnesswith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, withonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because locallaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stoolsfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. AfterSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool ofone patient 38 days after illness onset.     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), ninewere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range:0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sexmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant duringthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidencelimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patientsalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.749.8). Other Investigation Findings     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with casesprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in "jumbo" patties produced onNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributedto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in theUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in theHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducingthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughterplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No oneslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission infamilies and child day care settings is ongoing.Reported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of PublicHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; KMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PITarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology andPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children's Hospital andMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JMKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has sinceemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most commoncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linkedmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although otherfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have beenimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenterstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, ahigher rate than for any other pathogen.     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because mostclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism onHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnessesassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groupsand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations andcomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patientsdevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%.     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing communityoutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despitethe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized inthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens frompersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5).When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reportedto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, publichealth action to prevent further cases.     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and cancontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S.Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identifycritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reducethe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply.Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat withpathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogensfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to beinternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cookground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juicesare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely playedan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interimrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993).     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this reportand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could beconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations ofoutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation ofthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infectionscaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E.coli O157:H7.Reference1.

Long-term use ofsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk oforal cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons whocurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1).To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products,CDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and DiseasePrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewingtobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian,noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. Thisreport summarizes findings from this survey.     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked "Have you used snuff at least 20times in your entire life?" and "Do you use snuff now?" Similar questions wereasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users ofsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobaccouse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at thetime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported havingused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at thetime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current andformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking atleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers asthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were notsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data onsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than orequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to providenational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by usingstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN)(3).     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current usersof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%)women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobaccouse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use washighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence washighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence ofsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/AlaskanNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among AmericanIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence ofsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence wassubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and inrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher amongHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 1Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant onlyfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1).     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among thoseaged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use ofchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Althoughwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highestamong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported beingformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who wereformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among personsaged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95%CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former userswas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5%95% CI=68.9-78.1).     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0)currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95%CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95%CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco.     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3%95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.649.6).Reported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic DiseasePrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, NationalCenter for Health Statistics, CDC.Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokelesstobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, inparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies thatlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oralsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging thisbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk fornicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4).     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use amongracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levelsand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that requirefurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a rolein maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting thedifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6).     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of currentsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, theprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobaccousers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previousstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smokedHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 1Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smokedreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort tostop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential healthimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established specialpopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokelesstobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no morethan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower theprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokelesstobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts,enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxescommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers toroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-basedprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibittobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).Reference1.
