A friend of mine is going in later this week for tests to see if haemphysema.  His lung capacity has decreased over time.  His father dieof the disease.  He works in woodworking.  I believe he has a veroccasional cigarette, perhaps one cigarette a day or even less.  He tellme this..I've never seen him light up.  He has some pretty healthlife style habits, good diet, exercise, meditation, retreats, therapetc.  Anyhow..he is very concerned with this check up.  I know reallnothing about the disease.  I believe it interferes with the lininof the lung being able to exchange oxygen. Is a diagnosis of emphysema a death sentence?  If he were to give up smokinentirely would that better his chances for recovery?  What are somemodern therapies used in people with this disease?  I would appreciateany information.  Thanks.  amigan@cup.portal.co
