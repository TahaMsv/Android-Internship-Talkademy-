>>Hello, a friend is under going kemotherapy(sp?) for breast cancer. I'>trying to learn what I can about it. Any info would be appreciated>ThanksYou've asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs whicare used for chemotherapyThe overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling.  Some othese crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destrocancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have differeneffects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more thaone drug at a timeSome chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cyclof a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycleThe first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesiand RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occursThe third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesizedaagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divideThere are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesisOthers stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesisAt any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cellto stop growingIf what you are seeking is "practical" advice, I apologize for ramblinon the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugare rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and toexperience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating smalfrequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafteknown as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicinetthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medicationscan be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are importantProbably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not alwayhappen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the personthemself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have differenside effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snuheadband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumablby reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on thitoo, I would love to see it, and possibly some bib dataI highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer SocietyThey have a vast selection of literature and information.  In additionif your friend has had a mastectomy, I highly recommend "Reach for Recovery"It is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breastbecause of cancer.  They can offer some excellent support and suggestionsIf you have further questions, please send me E-mail.  I hav some gooaccess to information, and I enjoy trying to help other peopleI wish the best to you and your friend
