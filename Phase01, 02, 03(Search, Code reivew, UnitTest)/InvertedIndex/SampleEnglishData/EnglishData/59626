The degree oelevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten timenormal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal.As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease.Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, aleast initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means oa biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient witCAH needs to be treated=====================================Howard Doyldoyle+@pitt.ed
