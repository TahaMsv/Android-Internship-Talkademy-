My girlfriend just started taking Imitrex for her migraine headaches.  Heneurologist diagnosed her as having depression and suffering from rebounheadaches due to daily doses of analgesics.  She stopped taking alanalgesics and caffine as of last Thursday (4/15).  The weekend was prettbad, but she made it through with the help of Imitrex about every 18 hours Her third injection of Imitrex, during the worst of the withdrawl oFriday and six hours after the first of the day, left her very sick.  Skiwas flushed, sweating, vomiting and had severe headache pain.  It subsidein an hour or so.  Since then, she has been taking Imitrex as needed tcontrol the pain.  Immediately after taking it, she has increased head paifor ten minutes, dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains.  A frienof hers mentioned that her doctor was wary of Imitrex because it had causeheart attacks in several people.  Apparently the mild chest pains wercommon in these other people prior to there attacks.  Is this just rumor?Has anyone else heard of these symptoms?
