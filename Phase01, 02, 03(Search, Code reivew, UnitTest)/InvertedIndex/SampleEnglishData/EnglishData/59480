Actually I am entering vet school next year, but the question isrelevant for med students tooMemorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academicallySince this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy,histology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part massmemorization -- I am a little concerned.  As I am sure mostmed students areCan anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization?  Ihave had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks likthinking up little stories to associate unrelated things.  But I havnever applied them to large amounts of "data"Has anyone had luck with any particular books, memory systems, ocheap software?  Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques?  Being aolder student who returned to school this year, organization (anotheone of my weak points) has been a major help to my successPlease no griping about how all you have to do is "learn" the materiaconceptually.  I have no problem with that, it is one of my strongpoints.  But you can't get around the fact that much of medicine irote memorization. Thanks for your help
