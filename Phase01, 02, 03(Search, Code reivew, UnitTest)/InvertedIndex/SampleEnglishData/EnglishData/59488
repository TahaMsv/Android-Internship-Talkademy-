Some of the MD's in this newsgroup have been riding my butt pretty goo(maybe in some cases with good reason).  In this post on depression, I'mlaying it all out.  I'll continue to post here because I think that I havesome knowledge that could be useful.  Once you have read this post, youshould know where I'm coming from when I post again in the future>> A family member of mine is suffering from a severe depression brought o> by menopause as well as a mental break down.

Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was arebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy andchemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her throughher six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  Whensevere depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried touse supplements to bring her out of it.  I had "cured" her PMS usingsupplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of dietin depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work andshe was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years afterby wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical andone reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or anotherstressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months withsupplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac.I was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done usingB6, niacin, folate and B12 to "cure" depression.  I\'m not going to do thatbecause all you would be doing is flying blind like I wasLida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But theproblem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then usean approach which will "fix" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactlywhat drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would beaffected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of thesestressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program waspretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need isa nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of yourbodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C),you have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of anynutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them frombeing emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increaseyour need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves becomevery importantLida, without your permission, I'm going to use your post as a conduit totry to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm comingfrom.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the OsteopathicMedical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook becausenone was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  Ipreach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to bymy students as sermons).

I last did thisin the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit downand rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate booksthat have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(whichI write myself) I've pulled figures, tables and graphs from variouscopyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used foreducational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can notsend this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do)I am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutritionassessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I needto make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure thenutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known tobe required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab todesign supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer TreatmentCenters of America, which is a private for-profit organization withhospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates anutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the PritikinClinic in California has a similiar lab setupFor physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the newClinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  Ihave been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brownseries book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared moreto residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutritiotextbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and itdoes a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess apatient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from thePreface of this new text"So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists,hematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledgeof nutrition as it related to their field of practice." "Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the UnitedStates require no formal instruction in nutrition."But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of theleading causes of death in this country are nutrition related."... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) itshould complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance ofnutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten yourawareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally importantfor both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentiallyevery organ system.Roland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPHLida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to finda physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and mineral(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression andwho could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time whenwomen suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that areoccuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  Anutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentionedthat his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a redcell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the seleniumreserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him totry to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There arealso a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineralanalysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs usingcertified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed somepretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someonewho will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they areusing a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical LaboratoryImprovement Act). A diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shownto correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food loggingand software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  Butthere are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do notshow a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve statusUntil we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in theU.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritionalprofile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that usesdiet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continueto be the best approach to depressionMartin Banschbach, Ph.DProfessor of Biochemistry and ChairmaDepartment of Biochemistry and MicrobiologOSU College of Osteopathic Medicin"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there isno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance.
