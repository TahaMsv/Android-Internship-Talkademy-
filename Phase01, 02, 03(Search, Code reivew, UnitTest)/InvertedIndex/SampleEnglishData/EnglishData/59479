>FLAME O>Especially the USA should be grateful; after all, Columbus did no>drop off the edge of the earth(WITH-COUNTERFLAME-ENABLE Columbus was indeed a crank, but not in the manner you think The fact that the world was round was well known when he set sail.  It wa also well known that the circumference was about 25K miles, and that you coul not reach Asia bo going west with current technology -- you would neither b able to carry enough supplies, nor get a long enough stretch of good sailin weather.  Nobody thought he would fall off the edge of the world.  Instead they expected him to die at sea Columbus thought for no good reason that the circumference was only 16K miles making the trip practical Unfortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, the Earth's circumference i indeed 25K miles Fortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, there was a stopping place righ about where Asia would have been had the circumference been 16K miles My source is the recent PBS series on Columbus>FLAME OFF, or end sermon :->-- Ale
