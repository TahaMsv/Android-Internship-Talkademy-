Thanks to all those who responded to my original post on this question.  Thfinal diagnosis was Stress.  I did not take her for a chiropractic adjustment(Rachel receives all her medical care at Keller Army Hospital since she is military dependant, and the Army does not yet provide chiropractic adjustmentas part of its regular health care.)  I am hoping that the arrival of (1Spring Break, and (2) College Acceptance Letters, will help.  *UNFORTUNATELYshe was wait-listed at the college she most dearly wanted to attend, so iseems as though that stressor may just continue for a while.  :-Meanwhile she is going on a camping trip with her religious youth group fospring break, which seems like a good stress-reliever to meThanks again for everybody's help/advice/suggestions/ideas-----------------------Ruth Ginzberg <rginzberg@eagle.wesleyan.eduPhilosophy Department;Wesleyan University;US
