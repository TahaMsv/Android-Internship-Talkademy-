Our 20-month son has started falling sick quite often every since hstarted going to day care.  He was at home for the first year and he dinot fall sick even once.  Now it seems like he has some sort of cold oflu pretty much once a month.  Most of the time the cold leads to an eainfection as well, with the result that he ends up being on antibiotic3 weeks out of 4.  I know kids in day care fall sick more often, but ware beginning to wonder how often "more often" really is, whether ouson is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average, what thlonger-term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics areand what we can do to build up his resistance.  He really enjoys his dacare and we think it's great too, but we are beginning to wonder whethewe should think about getting a nannyAre there any studies that can help answer some of these questions-- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sickHow often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?  Is there any data ohome care vs. day care-- Does being sick "build immunity" (leading to less illness later)does it make kids "weaker" (leading to more illness later), or does inot have any long term effect-- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative lonterm effects-- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness thanormal, and what does one do about it-- Is there any way to build immunity and resistanceAny data, information or advice relating to this would be mucappreciated.  Thanks a lotAshwin
