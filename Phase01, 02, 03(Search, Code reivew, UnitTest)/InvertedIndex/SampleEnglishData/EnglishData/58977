Someone I know has recently been diagnosed as having Candida Albicans,a disease about which I can find no information.  Apparently it has somethinto do with the body's production of yeast while at the same time being highlallergic to yeast.  Can anyone out there tell me any more about itThanks--David Partain                   |  davpa@ida.liu.sIDA, University of Link\\"oping  |  work phone:  +46 (013) 28 26 0S-581 83 Link\\"oping, Sweden    |  telefax:     +46 (013) 28 26 6
