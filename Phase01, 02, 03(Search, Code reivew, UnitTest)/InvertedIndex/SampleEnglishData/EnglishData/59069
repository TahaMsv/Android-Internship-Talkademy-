Most early treatment onon-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotaevidence given by the patient. It's an educated guess, by a trained personbut it's still no more than a guessIt's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with thospeople who don't respondThere are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of mandiseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterologsometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods havrun out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimentamethod they choose. And it's well recognized by many doctors that medicindoesn't have all the answersThis person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe it's miracle cure, maybe it's valid. How do you know? You might argue with the reasoning, the conclusions. But your disparaginattack is unwarranted. Why don't you present an convincing argument for yor beliefs, instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack-Jackie
