My 14-y-o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose.  bought him Clearasil face wash and ointment.  I think that is probablenough, along with the usual good diet.  However, he is on at me tget some product called Dalacin T, which used to be doctor's-prescription only treatment but is not available over thchemist's counter.  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who saeither his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T, or that Clearasiis OK.  I had the odd spots as a teenager, nothing serious.  Hifather was the same, so I don't figure his acne is going to escalatinto something disfiguring.  But I know kids are senstitive aboutheir appearance.  I am wary because a neighbour's son had this wiermalady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A froacne treatment.  I want to help - but with appropriate treatmentMy son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp.  Sorof teenage cradle cap.  Any pointers/advice on this?  We have tried couple of anti dandruff shampoos and some of these are inclined tmake the condition worse, not betterShall I bury the kid till he's 21 :--^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^            The floggings will continue until morale improves                 pchurch@swell.actrix.gen.nz  Pat Churchill, Wellington New Zealand
