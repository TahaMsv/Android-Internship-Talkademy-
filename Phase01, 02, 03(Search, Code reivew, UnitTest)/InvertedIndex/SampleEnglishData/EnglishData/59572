Thetypes of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cellsand these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearingprocess.  The hair cell nerve-like epithelial cells in the ear may respondto vitamin A during cellular differentiation(embryogenesis) but I don'tknow if they are still capable of responding in adults.  If they arecapable of responding with new hair growth, this would be a very majorbreakthrough in hearing loss.  With all of the medical interest in vitaminA, it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done usingvitamin A to reverse hearing loss.  But with only a news announcement to goon(and this type of communication is notoriously bad), I can't comment onyour question anymore than I already have.  If one study has been done,more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearingloss if there really is oneMarty B.
