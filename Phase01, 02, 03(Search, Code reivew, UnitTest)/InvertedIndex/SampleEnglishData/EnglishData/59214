Kirlian photography is taking pictures of the corona discharge froobjects (animate or inanimate).  The fields applied to the objects armillions of times larger than any biologically created fields.  If yowant to record the biologically created electric fields, you've got tuse low-noise, high-gain sensors typical of EEGs and EKGs.  Kirliaphotography is just phun-with-physics type stuff (right up there witsoaking chunks of extra-fine steel wool in liquid oxygen then hittinthem with a hammer -- which, like a Kirlean setup, is fun but possibldangerous): Perhaps such pictures will be diagonistic of disease problems i: organisms when better understood.
