I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there inetwork newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am gointo describe here.  I have a fourteen year old daugter who experiencea seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's FrosteFlakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything likthis before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of thfamily.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decisiowas made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened againWell, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she haa bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I aembarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every oncin a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think "Oh, oh, this is thsame kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure."  Tenminutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposurto a sugar coated cereal since the last seizureWhen I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason fothe seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Noafter this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, evehe is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which understand can happen even when a person has a seizureOnce again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be gooto get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has anexperience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medicacommunity are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet anfoods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you caguess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideaanyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really geacross what is going on hereThanks-Sharon Paulson                      s.s.paulson@larc.nasa.goNASA Langley Research CenteBldg. 1192D, Mailstop 156           Work: (804) 864-224Hampton, Virginia.  23681           Home: (804) 596-236
