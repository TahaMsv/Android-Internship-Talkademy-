I've beewearing Miracle Ear canal aids for about 5 months now and I find them to bacceptable.  They are molded to the shape of your ear canal, and tuned toyour hearing curve.  They are comfortable to wear and almost invisible, iyou're worried about that (although if you're currently wearing behind thear models, that's not an issue).  The cost:  I paid $1200 each for minethrough the Miracle Ear counter at Sears.  I've heard that there is substantial discount for senior citizens, but I haven't researched that, becausI'm not a senior citizen, yetGive them a try; you might be pleasantly surprised--Alan Hepburn           "A man doesn\'t know what he knowNational Semiconductor       until he knows what he doesn\'t know.Santa Clara, Ca             alan@berlioz.nsc.com                              Thomas Carlyl
