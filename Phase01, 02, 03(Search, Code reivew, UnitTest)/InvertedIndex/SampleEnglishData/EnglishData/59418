=>Yup.  The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf betwee=>the plates, and taking a Kirlian photograph of it.  You then cut off part o=>the leaf, put the top plate back on, and take another Kirlian photograph.  Yo=>see pretty much the same image in both cases.  Turns out the effect isn'=>nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates betwee=>photographs.  Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the plac=>conducts electricity.  Surprise, surprise=\tThis is true, but it's not quite the whole story.  There were=\tactually some people who were more careful in their methodolog=\twho also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.You can also replicate the effect with a rock:  Take your first Kirliaphotograph.  Then moisten one edge of the rock.  Lo! and behold!
