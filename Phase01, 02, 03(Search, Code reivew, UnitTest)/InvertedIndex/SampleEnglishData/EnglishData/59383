The patient is lowered into a bath ode-ionized water and carefully positioned.  High intensity pressurwaves are generated by an electric spark in the water (you don't geelectrocuted because de-ionised water does not conduct).  These waves arfocused on the kidneys by a parabolic reflector and cause the stone tbreak up.  This is completely painlessOf course, you then have to get these little bits of gravel througthe urethra.
