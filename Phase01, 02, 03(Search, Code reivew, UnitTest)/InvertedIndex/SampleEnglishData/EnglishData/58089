I noticed a negative correlatiowith ear infections and length of time nursed in my very small sampleI do notice that the 16 and 18 year old seem to eat a lot, could thabe from the breast feeding :-)  I don\'t understand the "unfit mother" charge other than any tactic inot too low down for some folks during divorce/child custody battlesMost of the developing nations practice breast feeding to 3 and 4 yearold.
