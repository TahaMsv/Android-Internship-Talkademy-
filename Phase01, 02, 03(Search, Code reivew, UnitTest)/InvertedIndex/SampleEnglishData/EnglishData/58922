>>One problem is very few scientists are interested in alternative medicine>So Gordon, why do you think this is so>--Probably because most of them come packaged with some absurd theorbehind them.  E.G. homoeopathy: like cures like.  The more you dilutthings, the more powerful they get, even if you dilute them so mucthere is no ingredient but water left.  Chiropractic: all illnesstems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  Sucsystems are so patently absurd, that any good they do is accidentaand not related to the theory.  The only exception is probably herbalismbecause scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plantand are always interested in seeing if they can find new plantthat have active and useful substances.  But that isn't whatis meant by alternative medicine, usually.  If you get into the Qiaccupuntunce charts, etc, you are now back to silly theories thaprobably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some casesPerhaps another reason they are reluctant is the Rhine experienceRhine was a scientist who wanted to investigate the paranormaand his lab was filled with so much chacanery and fakery thatpeople don't want to be associated with that sort of thing. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, angeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."---------------------------------------------------------------------------
