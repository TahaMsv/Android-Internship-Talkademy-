I have osteoarthritis, and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabete(type II, I guess--no insulin).I've been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what reallsurprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known.Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable foarthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the verconditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for thweight gain.For myself, I'm almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentland sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in aboueight small meals), the weight won't go off gradually and stay off.Instead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with mucinterest, like bread on the watersWith this experience, it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I casuggest is to make it as gradual as possibleMeanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just balanced diet.  It's almost impossible to tell from their writings -whichparts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition, anwhich are merely ideas the expert thinks are niftyIs it my imagination, or are these very old conditions very poorlunderstood?  Is it just that I\'m used to pediatrician-talk ("It\'s strepgive him this and he\'ll get well.") and so my expectations are too high?Bonita Kal
