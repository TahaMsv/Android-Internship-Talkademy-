As soon as you possibly can.  Thdifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recoverand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-varietdoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generallyany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists ithese kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTORThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, froa wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (OccupationaSafety and Health Service): "Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment anRehabilitation: A Practitioner\'s Guide"First, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands)(note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injurie  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RS  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RS  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RS  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint  Pronation: Turning the palm down  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up  Supination: Turning the palm up  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb  Abduction: Moving away from the body  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wideNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffusconditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific musclestendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurtDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscldiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas otenderness in muscles, although they\'re not necessarily "the problem.--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theoryNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries whicpass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restricthe blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full poweryou're completely restricting your blood flowWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run outthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generatenasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause painOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve thload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makethings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flowand the cycle continuesAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness froyour nerves.  They need blood tooAnyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a changfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles neverelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and pooergonomics, only make things worse--- Specific injuries you may have heard of(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acutinjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions havless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitioccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough tcause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's abilitto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, getinflamed, and you've got your problemTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendocan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separatingand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, morswelling, and more pain.  "Sub-acute" tendonitis is more common, which entaila dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worswith repetitive activityCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into youfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms includfeeling "pins and needles", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensationCTS is often confused for a diffuse conditionAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is wherthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possiblcompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhereAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOSdisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy)Others: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name foa way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctormisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, yomay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opiniobefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery)==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatmenThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reductension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relaxIf you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune outhe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guidinprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second breakEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it everthree minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundingscalm down, and relaxIf you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, anrelaxation are really a big dealThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reducinflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent baposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengtheyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posturand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-colcontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's besfor you--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this wawritten in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim froAppendix 10. -- dwallach. Let your shoulders relax. Let your elbows swing free. Keep your wrists straight. Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine. Try leaning back in the chair. Don't slouch or slump forward. Alter your posture from time to time. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backwardSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  Thereshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the kneesand your thighs should not slope too muchNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortablto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using footrestNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the spacbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you ithe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in thiareaIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaninback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available[Now, I diverge a little from the textA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, gfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angleback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get ithe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a goostore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for youIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend "Just Chairs."  Thname says it all--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacementsThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For sompeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, yoshouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer youkeyboard to be "right there".  If you drop your arms at your side and thelift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your handwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoipronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist padmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come anlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It'often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders odeviated handsSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorldesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, todayCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail==5== Requests for more infClearly, the above information is incomplete.
