Here is a press release from the Natural Resources Defense Council New Data Show About 100 Major U.S. Water Supplies Vulnerable TMilwaukee-Type Disease Outbrea To: National Desk, Environment Write Contact: Erik Olson or Sarah Silver, 202-783-7800, bot          of the Natural Resources Defense Counci   WASHINGTON, April 14  -- Internal EPA data releasetoday by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that abou100 large water systems -- serving cities from Boston to SaFrancisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organismleaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a diseasoutbreak similar to the one affecting Milwaukee   The EPA list is attached   "These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of watesupplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequatpollution controls or filtration," said Erik Olson, a senioattorney with NRDC.  "Water contamination isn\'t just a problem iBangladesh, it\'s also a problem in Bozeman and Boston.   "As of June 29, 1993, about 100 large surface water systems oEPA's list probably will be breaking the law.  The 1986 SafDrinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to eithefilter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they usfrom pollution," Olson continued.  Some systems are movintowards eventually implementing filtration systems but arexpected to miss the law's deadline   Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is alreada reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surfacwater systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percenof raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organiscryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasitcalled giardia   Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Officstudy released today by House Health and Environment SubcommitteChairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in thnation's system for conducting and following through on sanitarsurveys of water systems   "This new information raises a huge warning sign that millionof Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and bassured that their water is safe to drink.  We must immediatelput into place programs to protect water sources frocontamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipmenmust be installed to protect the public," Olson noted.  "The timhas come for many of the nation's water utilities to stodragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water frocontamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costneeded to assure their water is safe to drink.
