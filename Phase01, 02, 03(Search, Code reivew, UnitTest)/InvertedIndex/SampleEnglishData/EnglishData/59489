Hi StepheEar wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventina barrier and also with some antibiotic properties.  Too much can block thexternal auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause somehearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on youown, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) anfill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogeperoxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees upand insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and firmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and thtenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowlunder the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can bua syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whateveyou may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can tradding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften uthe wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is alssafe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinsit outGood Luc-heathe
