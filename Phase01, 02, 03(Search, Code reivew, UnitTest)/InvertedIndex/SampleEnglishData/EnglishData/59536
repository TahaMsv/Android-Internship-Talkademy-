Does it seem to be workingI just got back from the American Academy of Neurology annual meetingwhere the consensus was that sumatriptan (Imitrex) has no advantageover DHE-45 nasal spray, which is much less expensive, has fewer sideffects, is as effective, and works more quickly (5-10 minutes vs. 30)Besides, who wants to give themselves a shot (sumatriptan) when a nasaspray works?  DHE nasal spray is not widely available yet -- it has tbe mail ordered from one of a few pharmacies in the country -- but mosneurologists now know about it and know how to order itDavid Nye (nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu).
