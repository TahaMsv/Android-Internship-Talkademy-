Can anybody explain why thi|> particular activity, which does not seem to stress me very much generally|> should cause this shoulder problemYou need to use your shoulder muscles to push the mower. If you haven't beedoing much exercise, as I suppose you haven't, then a constant 20 minutlong effort can cause stiffness and cramps-philipp
