I hope Gordon Banks did not mean to imply that notions such ahard-to-see candida infections causing various problems should nobe investigated.  Many researchers have made breakthroughs byfiguring out how to investigate things that were previously though"virtually impossible to test for.Indeed, I would be surprised if "candida overbloom" were such phenomena.  I would think that candida would produce signaturbyproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on theextent of recent infection.  I realize this might get quitetricky and difficult, probably expensive, and likely inconvenienor uncomfortable to the subjects, but that is not the same as"virtually impossible.Russel
