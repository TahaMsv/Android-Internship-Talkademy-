Organization: Temple UniversitX-Newsreader: NNR/VM S_1.3.Last week I went to see a gastroenterologist. I had never met thidoctor before, and she did not know what I was there for. As soon as arrived, somebody showed me to an examining room and handed me a gownThey told me to undress (from the waist down, to be exact) and wait for thdoctor. Is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the firstime? I don't have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood), buon the couple of occasions when I've gone to a new doctor, I met hiwith my clothes on. First, he introduced himself, asked what I was therfor and took a history, all before I undressedAre patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctofor the first time? Personally, I'd prefer to meet the doctor osomething remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish aidentity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. Inothing else, it minimizes the time that I have to spend in the selconscious, ill at ease and vulnerable condition of a person with a barbottom talking to somebody who is fully clothedDoes anybody besides me regard this get-naked-first-and-then-we-can-talattitude as insensitive? Also, is it unusualJames Arbuckle                          Email:  v5113e@vm.temple.ed
