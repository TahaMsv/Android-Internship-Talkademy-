I use a ZYGON Mind Machine as bought in the USA last year.  Althougit's no wonder cure for what ail's you.  It is however VERY good astopping you thinkingSound strange?  Well suppose you're tired and want to go to bed/sleepBUT your head is full of niggling problems to resolve, you lay in thbed, and quickly they all come to the surface, churning around from onunresolved thing to the next and then back again.  Been there, boughthe t-shirtI slip on the Zygon and select a soothing pattern of light & sound, anquickly I just can't concentrate on the previous stuff. Your brain'cache kinda get's flushed, and you start on a whole new set of stuffA useful addition, is the facility to feed the output of a tape playeor CD through the box, I use New Age elevator muzak to enhance thoverall effectDEFFO better than a pillCheers Nige   ***********************************************************************   * NIGEL BALLARD  | INT: nigel@dataman.demon.co.uk |      I'M PINK         * BOURNEMOUTH UK | CIS: 100015.2644   RADIO-G1HOI | THEREFORE I'M SPAM    ***********************************************************************
