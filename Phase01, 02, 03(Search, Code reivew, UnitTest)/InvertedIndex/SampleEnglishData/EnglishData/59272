Is that rightYou might look for an allergy doctor in your area who uses sublinguadrops instead of shots for treatment. (You are given a small bottle oantigens; 3 drops are placed under the tongue for 5 minutes.) Mallergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way. Throughout the treatmenprocess I had to return to the doctor's office every month for re-testinand a new bottle of antigens. After the allergy was completely neutralizea bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about 4 months (the sublinguadrops are then taken 3 times per week), and costs $20. So the cost iless than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at homeBruce Lon
