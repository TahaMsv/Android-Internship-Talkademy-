Is thi>"corona discharge"I think I can explain the "missing part of a leaf" storyI have actually seen a reproduction of that particular Kirliaphotograph, in a book compiled by people who were enthusiasts oKirlian photography.  "That particular photograph" ... ?  That\'right, the effect has been observed only once.  Even the writers othe book were inclined to disbelieve in it. I conjecture that the maker of that photograph began by placina whole leaf between two plates and taking its Kirlian photoFor his next experiment, he cut the leaf in half, put one half dowbetween the same two plates, and took another K. p.  Th"missing half" effect was created by water, oils, etc. left behindafter the first photoThis explanation must be tentative, because after all I wasn't therwhen it happened. RegardsChris Henric
