As an animal science student, I know that a number of animals transfeimmunoglobin to thier young through thier milk.  In fact, a calf _musthave a sufficient amount of colostrum (early milk) within 12 hours teffectively develop the immune system, since for the first (less than24 hours the intestines are "open" to the IG passage.  My question isdoes this apply to human infants to any degreeThanks for your time respondingMatthew Keelec599143@mizzou1.missouri.ed
