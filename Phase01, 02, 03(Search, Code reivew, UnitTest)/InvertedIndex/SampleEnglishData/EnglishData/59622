    Jim Haynes wants to know the following is a scam...       There's a chiropractor who has a stand in the middle of a shoppin       mall, offering free examinations.  Part of the process involves        multiple-jointed sensor arm and a computer that says in a computer       sounding voice "digitize left PSIS" "digitize right PSIS" "digitiz       C7" "please stand with spine in neutral position".  I\'m wonderin       whether this doesn't really measure anything and the computer voic       is to impress the victims, or whether it is measuring somethin       that chiropractors think is useful to measureEarth to sci.med....If it looks like a duck...and quacks like a duck.....This is a TOTAL scam. Since the beginning of chiropraxis, the chiropractor hastried to sell The Subluxation as The Problem and then sell themselves antheir Adjustments as The Solution. The Chiropractic Subluxation is a delusionaldiagnosis and the Adjustments of Subluxations by extension constitute adelusional medicineThe wide spectrum of chiropractic Techniques ALL have their own methods fordetecting Spinal Demons and unique methodolgies for Excorcizing Them. Thecomputer approach is an attempt to 'sell with science' but this device isnothing more than a 'high-tech' Subluxation Detector.....and in the end..AMAZINGLY...it will show the potential 'patient' to suffer from...VS.....Vertebral Subluxation....The Silent KillerJohn Badanes, DC, Cromdas@uclink.berkeley.ed
