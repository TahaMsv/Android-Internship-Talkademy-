Since then, I have had periodic muscle spasms (nocramping, but twitching that is very fast) in some of thmuscle groups along the lateral side, and along the top omy foot.TX with quinine sulfate produced ringing in my ears, but dihelp with the spasmsI am on flexeril now, but no discernable help with the spasmsAny ideasOne thing - I am in a short leg cast, so heat is not the answerRenee Robert
