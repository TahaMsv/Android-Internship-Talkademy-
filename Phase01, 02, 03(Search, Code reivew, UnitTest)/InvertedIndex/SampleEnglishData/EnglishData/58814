As a matter of fact, I am not feeling soI was also at a Neurologist's too, he considered me healthy tooThe blood tests have shown that I have little too much of Hemoglobin (17.5common range is 14 to 17, I unfortunately do not know about the units)Could these hemi-sided pains be the result of this or of a also possiblblock of the neck muscles I have no fever, and I am not feeling entirely sick, but neither entirelyhealthy.Please answer by direct email on <ghilardi@urz.unibas.chThanks for every hinNic
