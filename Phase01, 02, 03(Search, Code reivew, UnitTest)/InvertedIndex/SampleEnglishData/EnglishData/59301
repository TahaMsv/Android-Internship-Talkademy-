Given the exception of TENS and similar units used for external electricalstimulation, usually for pain relief, not really a light and sound machineThey are _not_ experimental in the sense of a specific medicalcategory to that effect, as with experimental drugs, as the FDA does notspecifically regulate medical devices in the way it does pharmaceuticals.  >I would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly usefulThere are few reliable studies of therapeutic or enhancement effectfor mind machines, other than those relaxation-related effects found withmeditation or self-hypnosis as well.  Reported benefits are mostly anecdotal ansubjective so far, so it's hard to generalize about their potential valueA pretty good general non-technical introduction to a wide varietof these devices may be found in "Would the Buddha Wear a Walkman ?Some interesting background material, names of suppliers, and capsule reviewof specific equipment. >do these mind machines (aka Light and Sound machines) work? can they induc>alpha, theta, and/or delta waves in a person wearing them?

'Biofeedback' was found to be a legitimatand reliable effect experimentally under certain conditions, (in thait demonstrated that we can influence physiological processes previouslyconsidered purely autonomic) but never panned out as a particularly valuabletherapeutic tool because of the skill level required and the subtlety antemporary nature of the effects in most cases.
