You might notice thamany of the natives have wads in their mouths... the tea can be obtained in SAmerican pharmacies. This remedy alleviates some of the lightheadedness andizziness - but don't try to jog with it. I've tried this when travelling anhiking in Peru and Ecuador. The amount of cocaine you would ingest are too minutto cause any highs..Also it is a good idea to eat lightly and dress warm while adjusting to high altitudes
