A friend of mine is having some symptoms and has asked me to posthe following informationA few weeks ago, she noticed that some of her hair was startinto fall out.  She would touch her head and strands of hair wouljust fall right out. (by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old). It continued to occur until she had a bald spot about thsize of a half dollar.  Since that time, she  has gotten twmore bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she'described include:  several months of an irregular menstruacycle (which is strange for her, because she has always beeextremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wakup one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next dait's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one thaknocked her to the ground; and general fatigueShe went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reasofor the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspectethyroid problems.  He did the blood work and claims that everythincame back normal. She's very concerned and very confused.  Does anyone have anideas or suggestions?  I told her that I thought she shoulsee an endocrinologist.  Does that sound like the right idea** By the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recentltaken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn'recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm,coloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to faloutThanks in advance for any help
