In comparison, inthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overalldecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase ingonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence ofthis disease from 1985 through 1992.     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Departmentof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992,reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported caseswith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7%of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases byage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than orequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of allreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for thelargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest agegroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000).     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denvermetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in thestate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan areaoccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoodsconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiencysyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed amongmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic inthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visitsby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of casesdiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men,the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed amongself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992,respectively).     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO,university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contactedto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrheaculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in thefourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites andHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacksHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 1Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Coloradoincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992,the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that forwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000)(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, casesincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.Reported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; REHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br,Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center forPrevention Svcs, CDC.Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or morecomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDHsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrheacases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratoriessuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planninglaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that thegonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea inColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in arecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan areacoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requiresfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicatedpreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6)-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whomgonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs,and gang affiliation.     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds thenational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor forgonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups atgreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, racespecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such associoeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado,interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targetingpartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups atincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old blackmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radioHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 1Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters inschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targetedprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators toperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educationalinterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance ofmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leadersand health-care providers.Reference1.

Child safety seats and safetybelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safetybelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children byan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a majorcause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use ofoccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage forthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). Inaddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely touse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association betweenadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraintsfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDCanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from thisstudy.     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based,random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard InjuryControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondentwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use forthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use inthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less thanconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Softwarefor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimatesand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were definedby p values of less than 0.05.     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had nolaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania,and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., avehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuseof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primaryenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for asafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protectionHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 1Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two statesused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a lawrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law(no-law states).     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were notconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use andadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-squaretest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus43.2%, respectively).     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less thanconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reportedhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, foradults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of childoccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1%for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children ofconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adultsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest agegroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceededthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition,higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated withincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associatedwith increased adult safety-belt use (8).Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; NationalCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with othersindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likelyto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because thesenonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibitother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greaterrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10).     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated withchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programsshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because loweducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, suchprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that servelow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that aredirected at parents with young children.     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. Inaddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants asHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 1Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment,those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that donot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safetybelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats andsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children mayincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers --the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and thehighest rate of fatal crashes (5).Reference1.

Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillancein metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California forthe years 1983-1988.     Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Programand the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two populationbased surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. Theprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 19831988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitanAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race,sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetalalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of thekidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to generaldiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/handlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) areprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because thesedefects are relatively easy to diagnose.     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancytermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However,the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may berelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the genepool, or random variation.     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, severalcollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences inthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention onthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-8     Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenzavirus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annuallyfrom October through May.     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillanceconducted from October 1988 through May 1989.     Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics officesof 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHOcollaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenzaviruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state andterritorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were receivedthroughout the year.     Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and Bviruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequencyoverall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shiftedover the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indicesof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated weresimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% ofidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtypeincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes werereported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenzaA(H1N1).     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance ofinfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes theimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, sinceamantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data producedthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to makeinformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annualsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidatesfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizon                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive TechnologieFollowing the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVFET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have beendeveloped that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT),embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together,these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductivetechnology (ART) procedures.Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/orpathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertilitymanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate toproceed with one of the ART procedures.Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertilityservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology andInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes inART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patientsin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by thetraditional therapies.The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in ourCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers therealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are:o in vitroo fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube  transfero (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directedtowards improved success of these technologies.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199                           Future Areas of ResearcIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward themanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assistcouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditarydisease.This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and thensubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNAamplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification byother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis andhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification ofwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibitsex-linked disorders.The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact thatit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibilityof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birthof affected children.Catherine Racowsky, Ph.DAssociate Professor and Director of ResearcDepartment of Obstetrics and GynecologCollege of MedicineUniversity of ArizonTucson, Arizon               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for th                           Management of InfertilitThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of ArizonaCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility.

This procedure involves retrieval ofunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, andthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferredto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator understrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before beingprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in ourandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computerHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which toperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typicallystimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasinghormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depolupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggsobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopicegg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia,we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in ourInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.      Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubaldeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of malefactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overallsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent percycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure isdisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiologicalfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Wellrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenousovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycleattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinantof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to anAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure oftraditional therapies.     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has notbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggsavailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization ratessignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years;and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age isunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in ourCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that maybe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs thatfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significantproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently,the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Ourprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needsof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room,usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involvesintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopiantube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilizationoccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF,with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing fortransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases inHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has suchpathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertilityand/or idiopathic infertility.        The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtainedwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one mightexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in ourprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, whilesubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit thepatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performinga procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoinggeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued fromobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs,and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificialenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. BetweenJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFTcycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program whenembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity forsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethicalissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulatedby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, fromboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programsshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new,is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen butwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml incombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing theprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm underthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the spermthrough enzymatic digestion.     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedlyrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniquesfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Suchefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technologyoffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients toestablish conception.Catherine Racowsky, Ph.DHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 2Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 199Associate Professor and Director of ResearcDepartment of Obstetrics and GynecologCollege of Medicine--------- end of part 2 -------------      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-116      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/1                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.n
