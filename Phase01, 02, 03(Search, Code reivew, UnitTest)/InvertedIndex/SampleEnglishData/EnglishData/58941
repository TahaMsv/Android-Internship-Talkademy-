[...   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITIO   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  Wha   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet   [Reproduced without permission\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed unde\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than i\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a grou\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, an\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest afte\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred \tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researcher\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite di\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do no\tnecessarily go hand in hand\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examinin\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of th\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkin\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase i\tthe amount of food eaten afterward\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causin\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for \thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the governmen\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causin\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before an\tafter the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confir\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why th\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged wit\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association'\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administratio\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, \tclean bill of health\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an "acceptable daily intake" o\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To excee\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to tak\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans o\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,..\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligram\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cup\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame conten\tof selected foods omitted\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay awa\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder calle\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,00\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essentia\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a chil\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately caus\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people wit\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and othe\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning "Phenylketonurics\tContains Phenylalanine.-Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.
