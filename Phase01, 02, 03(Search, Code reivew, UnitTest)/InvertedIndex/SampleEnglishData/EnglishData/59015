If you have an obvious hernia sac coming downinto your scrotum, or a bulge in your groin that is brought about bincreasing intra-abdominal pressure...Sometimes is not that obvious. The hernia is small and you can onlydetect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal.Whether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previouoperation, I can't tell you. The person that examined you is in  the besposition to make that determinationAre there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia? Every now and thenfolks write about CT scans and ultrasounds for this. But these are fatoo expensive, and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger===================================Howard Doyldoyle+@pitt.ed
