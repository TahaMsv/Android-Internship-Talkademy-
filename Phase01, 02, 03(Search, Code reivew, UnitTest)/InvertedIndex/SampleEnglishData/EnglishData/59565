writesFriend's unpleasant experience uring CT scan delete>Is there anything I can do about these pigs I'd suggest writing a detailed letter about the incident to thhospital administrator. Specify the date and time. If possible thnames of the technicians.Send a copy to the clinician under whose care your friend waadmitted. I say this because, though your friend has no argumenwith the doctor, I have found that administrators sometimes ignorcomplaints until the patient becomes litigious.

Do this weekly until yodo get a responseCAT scans are non-invasive but they can be very scary. The scannecan be a bad place for the claustrophobic. There was an interestinstudy in the BMJ, about 10 years ago, which found that around 10% opeople who had CAT scans found it so unpleasant that they woulnever have another. This compares with 15% who said the same about lumbar puncture.Don Mackie - his opinion
