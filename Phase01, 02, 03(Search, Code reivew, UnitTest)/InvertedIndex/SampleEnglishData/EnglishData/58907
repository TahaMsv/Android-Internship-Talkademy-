Note that I wouldn't have any argumenwith a statement like "noting that animal administration has produced the following [blah, blah], we must be careful about ituse in humans."

It\'s just that this "projected safetmargin" is a construct derived from animal models and given thatyou can "prove" anything you like.

You\'re being intellectually dishonest (or jusplain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarilhave anything to do with each other.  Olney's reports would argue a potentiafor problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anythinwhatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide anstudies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvioureasons.)  It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenoof the "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome".  It says nothing about the frequeninability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab>>dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com>Hmm. ".com".
