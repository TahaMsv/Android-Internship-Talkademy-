While in grad school, I remember a biochemistry friend of mine working wit"heat shock proteins". Apparently, burning protein will induce changes in hDNA. Whether these changes survive the denaturing that occurs during digestioI don't know, but I never eat burnt food because of this.Also, many woods contain toxins. As they are burnt, it would seem logical thasome may volatilise, and get into the BBQed food. Again, I don't know if thestoxins (antifungal and anti-woodeater compounds) would survive the rather harsconditions of the stomach and intestine, and then would they be able to crosthe intestinal mucosaMaybe someone with more biochemical background than myself (which is almos*anyone*... :)) can shed some light on heat shock proteins and the toxins thamay be in the wood used to make charcoal and BBQAnne-Marie Rousseae-mail: rousseaua@immunex.coWhat I say has nothing to do with Immunex
