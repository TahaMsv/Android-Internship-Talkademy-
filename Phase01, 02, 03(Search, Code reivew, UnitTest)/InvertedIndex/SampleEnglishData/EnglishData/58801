   I have a BACK MACHINE and have had one since January.  While I have notfound it to be a panacea for my back pain, I think it has helped somewhat.It MAINLY acts to stretch muscles in the back and prevent spasms associatewith pain.  I am taking less pain medication than I was previously.    The folks at BACK TECHNOLOGIES are VERY reluctant to honor their returnpolicy.  They extended my "warranty" period rather than allow me to returnthe machine when, after the first month or so, I was not thrilled with it.They encouraged me to continue to use it, abeit less vigourously.   Like I said, I can't say it is a cure-all, but it keeps me stretched ouand I am in less pain-**********************************************************************Dale M.
