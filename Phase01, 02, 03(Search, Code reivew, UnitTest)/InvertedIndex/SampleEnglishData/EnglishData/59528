I was just wondeing, since you mentioned thhat she has aoncologistA bone scan is a nuclear scan.  Thperson receivving the scan is gven dose of a radioactive tracer, and an imaging device is used to track thdistribution of the tracer wwithin the body.  The tracer is usually giveintravenously.  (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant wilinsert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein.After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through thbody, the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect highconcentrations of the tracer.  The radiologist or doctor is looking foareas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of itAs far as pain, the only pain comes from the needle stick that is requireto start the IV lineWhat the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that mahave resulted from cancer.  This is also why I was wondering if your mothehas had cancer, since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in thskeletal systemI hope I have answered some of your questions.
