A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greatecan cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more arpotentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recalcorrectly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doseinvolves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, whicis a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts witsulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatiglutathione is used up, this intermediate then startattacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatinecrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is thdelay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of livedamage.  This is NOT a nice way to dieAs to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 gramof acetaminophen.  In a normal adult, this would probablcause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetiteBob Schmie
