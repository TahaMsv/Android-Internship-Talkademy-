:Being a chronic HBsAg carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chroni:persistent anything. Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical:biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chroni:persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellula:carcinoma:Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result o:a viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot b:determined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. I:consists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limitin:plate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contras:to chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation,:bridging necrosis, or fibrosis.:CPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH an:CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointe:out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would hav:it. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showin:areas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Mayb:it is a continuum. I don't knowDarn.  Just when I think I understand something someone who knows thpathology has to burst my bubble :-(  We'd better not start talking abouglomerular diseases, then I'll really get depressedSeriously though, I wonder how someone with CPH would end up getting biopsy in the first place?  My understanding (and feel free to correct meis that the enzymes are at worst mildly elevated, with overall normahepatic function.  I would think that the only clue might be a history oprior HepB infection and a positive HepB-sAg.  Or is it indeed on continuum with CAH, and the distinction merely one of pathology anprognosis, but otherwise identical clinical features--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   =  General Internal Medicine      |      "...dammit, not a programmer!" =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
