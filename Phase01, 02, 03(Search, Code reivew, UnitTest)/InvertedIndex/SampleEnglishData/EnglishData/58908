These have been popular, especially in Europeto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases-a few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he'had hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  IncredulouslyI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the activingredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skepticasputtering.  I have no idea how he's doing hemorrhoid-wise these daysThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds ihuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so threports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotalThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there'little risk of trying it, but I wouldn't expect much of a result--Steve Dyedyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dye
