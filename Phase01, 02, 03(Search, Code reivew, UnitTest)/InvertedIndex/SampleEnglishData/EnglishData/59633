Peopl>Against Cancer seems to offer pretty questionable information, no>exactly the place a cancer patient should be advised to turn toAnd where do you advise people to turn for cancer information Mos>(maybe all) of the infomation in their latest catalogue concer>treatments that have been shown to be ineffective against cancer, an>many of the treatments are quite dangerous as wellIt seems to me you've offered a circular refutation of Moss's organization. Whhas shown the information in the latest book of PAC to be questionable? Coulit be those 'regulatory' agencies and medical industries which Moss is showinto be operating with *major* vested interests. Whether one believes that thesvested interests are real or not, or whether or not they actually shape medicaresearch is a seperate argument. If one sees a possibility, however, that thesinterests exist, then the 'fact' that some of the information put out by PAhas been refuted by the medical industry doesn't hold much weightAs for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons, the fact that the NIH didn'find them effective doesn't make much sense here. Of course they didn't! tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive aftebeing told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon. They are fightinlike hell to keep that clinic open, and they credit his treatment with theisurvival. Anyone who looks at the NIH's record for investigation of 'alternative' cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for finding relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or uselessg
