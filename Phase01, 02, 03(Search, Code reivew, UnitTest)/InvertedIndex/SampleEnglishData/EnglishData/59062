I've recently listened to a tape by Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski, in which heclaims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anticancer properties that he names antineoplastons.  Burzynski says that hiswork has met with hostility in the United States, despite the favorableresponses of his subjects during clinical trialsWhat is the generally accepted opinion of Dr. Burzynski's research?  Hepaints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling anintolerant medical establishment, but I have no basis from which to judgehis claims.  Two weeks ago, however, I read that the NIH's Department ofAlternative Medicine has decided to focus their attention on Burzynski'swork.  Their budget is so small that I imagine they wouldn't investigate atreatment that didn't seem promisingAny opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the currentstatus of his research would be appreciated-Joshua Schwimmejschwimmer@eagle.wesleyan.ed
