I seem to recall that there was an article in Radio Electronics about thisubject. In fact I have a copy of the article in front of me, but I can'find anywhere in the article a refrence as to what month it was in. The systethey describe uses an automobile ignition coil for the high voltage. Thearticle even includes some information on what kind of film to use and whereto get it.Hope this helpsJoseph M.
