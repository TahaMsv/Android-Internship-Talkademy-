There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lungdisease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are sid-effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it alsobinds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths whenEDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances thatwere not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to removecalcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin Cand magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extravitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calciumfrom the plaques)The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probablycan be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietnswith calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium\t1. "Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review\t   Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).
