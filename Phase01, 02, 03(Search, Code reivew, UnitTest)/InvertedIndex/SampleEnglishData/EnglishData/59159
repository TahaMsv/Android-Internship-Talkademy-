Having been gone for 10 days, I'm way behind on my News reading, so manpardons if I am repeating something that has been said alreadyI read a good book while I was away, THE ANTIBIOTIC PARADOX: HOW MIRACLE DRUGARE DESTROYING THE MIRACLE, Stuart B. Levy, M.D., 1992, Plenum PressISBN:0-306-44331-7It is about drug resistant microorganisms & the history of antibiotics.  Iis interesting & written at a level which I think many sci.med readers woulappreciate -- which is:  it assumes an intelligent reader who is capable ounderstanding scientific concepts, but who may not yet have been exposed tthis particular information. I.e., it assumes you are smart enough tunderstand it, but it does not assume that you already have a degree imicrobiology or medicine.
