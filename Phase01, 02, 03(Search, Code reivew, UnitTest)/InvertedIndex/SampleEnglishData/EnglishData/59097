   someone wrote in expressing concern about getting AIDS from acupunctur   needles....Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who              themselves has AIDS..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get AIDS        from acupuncture needles. Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normaimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminantinvolved with acupuncture needle insertion.Most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They     do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission ofdiseases via this route...so it\'s good business to advertise "disposable needlesused here." These needles tend to be of a lower quality however,being poorly manufactured and too "sharp" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                       If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will gettheir own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.     The risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenlyuse an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong             patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminatesthis risk. Better quality needles tend to "slide" past vessels and           nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                       Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are allsolid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected intomeridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so requirethe same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will beinjected into the body as it would  be in a typical "shot." when the skin ispuntured. On the other hand when the solidacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to "squeeze" the needlefrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' thathaven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remainon the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior.Of course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatoryand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncturesiteWhile I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable diseasetransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know forwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.John Badanes, DC, Cromdas@uclink.berkeley.ed
