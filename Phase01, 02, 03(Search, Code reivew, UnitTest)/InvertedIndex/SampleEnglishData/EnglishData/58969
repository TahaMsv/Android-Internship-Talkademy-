Children diagnosed with AD   who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual an   social skills, which in fact continue to decline.  Of course, the parent   who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of thei   children\'s development.  So much for the value of "interesting anecdota   results".  People will believe anything if they want to   --   Steve Dye   dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyeThanks for all the interest in this problem of mine. I don't think iis a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never showany signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to foodShe has always been very calm and dare I say, a neat, smart kidThe fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals madby Kellog's makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction tsomething in the coating or the cereals.  Of the four of us in ouimmediate family, Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever, runninnose, itchy eyes, etc. but we have a lot of allergies in our family historincluding some weird food allergies - nuts, mushrooms.Anyway, our next trip is to an endocrinologist to check out the bodchemistry.  But so far, no more sugar coated cereals and no more seizureeither.  Every day that goes by without one makes me heave a sigh orelief.
