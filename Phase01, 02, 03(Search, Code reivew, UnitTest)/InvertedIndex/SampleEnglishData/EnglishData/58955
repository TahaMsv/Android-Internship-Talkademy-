I know that the placebo effect is where a patient feels better oreven gets better because of his/her belief in the medicine andthe doctor administering it.  Is there also an anti-placeboeffect where the patient dislikes/distrusts doctors and medicineand therefore doesn't get better or feel better in spite of themedicineIs there an effect where the doctor believes so strongly in amedicine that he/she sees improvement where the is none or seesmore improvement than there is?  If so, what is this effectcalled?  Is there a reverse of the above effect where the doctordoesn't believe in a medicine and then sees less improvement thanthere is?  What would this effect be called?  Have these effectsever been studied?  How common are these effects?  Thank you inadvance for all replies.... Information is very valuable but dis-information is MUCH more common
