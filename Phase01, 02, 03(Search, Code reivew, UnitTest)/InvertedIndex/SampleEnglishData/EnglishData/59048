Does the Bates method work?  I first heard about it in this newsgroupseveral years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, "How to improve yousight - simple daily drills in relaxation", by Margaret D. Corbett,('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  Ittalks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there beeany study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it byactually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasingthe lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for thetoo-long eyeballSince myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the moslogical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the processi.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there beeany recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works bychanging the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape ofeyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten theeyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates'sidea, right?Thanks for any information
