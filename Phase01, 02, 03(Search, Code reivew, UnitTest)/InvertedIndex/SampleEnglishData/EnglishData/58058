>How long does it take a smoker's lungs to clear of the tar after quitting?>Does your chances of getting lung cancer decrease quickly or does it tak>a considerable amount of time for that to happenThe answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer withoudoing a lot of autopsies.  The second question is something that's beeknown for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quittinsmoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of thperson who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in thinterim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack peday for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Stilrather low overall, but significant.  Personally, I'd be more concerneabout heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, aneven a small increase in risk is significant there--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   =  General Internal Medicine      |      "...dammit, not a programmer!  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
