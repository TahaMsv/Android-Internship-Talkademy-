There is a role for shorchain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouchethat are inflammed (Short is butyrate and shorter).  There may be a rolfor treatment of UC with Short chain fatty acids, and I am lookingforward to the upcoming AGA meeting in Boston to see what people ardoing. You raise a hypothesis about the studies and restriction of othefatty acids.  You should contact the authors directly about that oeven write a letter to the editor - it is a good point.  By the waythe abbreviation EPA is not in general use, so I do not know whatfatty acid you are speaking aboutAnd to Brian an U of C ---  There is a physician named Stephen Hanauethere who is a recognized expert in the treatment of IBD.  You mightgive him a call.  He is interested in new combinations of drugs forthe treatment of IBD.  If you call please say hello to him from meI was looking at U of C for a position, and perhaps still am.  Anbe sure to look into joining the CCFABest of LuckSteve Hollan
